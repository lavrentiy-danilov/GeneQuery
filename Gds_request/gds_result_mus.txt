(Submitter supplied) c-Fos, a member of the stress-activated Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, is expressed in human hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) we show that hepatocyte-specific expression of c-Fos leads to a proliferative, de-differentiated phenotype, whereas hepatocyte-specific deletion of c-Fos protects against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer. more...

2. Imiquimod has strain-dependent effects in mice and does not uniquely model human psoriasis
(Submitter supplied) Background: Imiquimod (IMQ) produces a cutaneous phenotype in mice frequently studied as an acute model of human psoriasis. Whether this phenotype depends on strain or sex has never been systematically investigated on a large scale. Such effects, however, could lead to conflicts among studies, while further impacting study outcomes and efforts to translate research findings.  Methods: RNA-seq was used to evaluate the psoriasiform phenotype elicited by IMQ in both sexes of 7 mouse strains (C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, CD1, DBA/1J, FVB/NJ, 129X1/SvJ and MOLF/EiJ). more...

4. A family of double-homeodomain transcription factors promotes zygotic genome activation in placental mammals [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) In metazoans, the fertilized embryo is transcriptionally mostly silent for a few cell divisions, until release of a first major wave of embryonic transcripts by so-called zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Maternally provided ZGA-triggering factors have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio but their mammalian homologues are still undefined. Here, we reveal that DUX family transcription factors are key to this process in human and mouse. more...

How this functional transition takes place is still controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that ablation of Foxo1 after GC development led to the loss of the DZ GC B cells and disruption of the GC architecture. Mechanistically, even upon provision of adequate T cell help, Foxo1-deficient GC B cells showed less proliferative expansion than controls. more...

37. Expression data that were specifically regulated by lncRNA-LFAR1 in mouse primary HSCs
(Submitter supplied) Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes; however, few have been identified that regulate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the progression of liver fibrosis. Through a detailed analysis of the expression of lncRNAs in various tissues, we discovered the existence of a liver enriched lncRNA-LFAR1 (lncRNA-Liver Fibrosis Associated RNA1). To identify the roles of  lncRNA-LFAR1 in liver fiboris, we systematically analyzed the regulation of mRNAs in primary HSCs infected with two separated lnc-LFAR1-shRNAs by RNA-seq, which revealed a panel of mRNAs that were specifically regulated by lncRNA-LFAR1 in mouse primary HSCs.

39. Cooperation between the pioneer factor OCT4 and chromatin remodeller BRG1 matures transcription factor binding in embryonic stem cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Pioneer transcription factors are able to recognise and bind their motif sequences in inaccessible or closed chromatin, and their ability to achieve this is required to establish new regulatory elements and transcriptional networks during development and cellular reprogramming. An essential feature of this pioneering activity is the transition from inaccessible chromatin to a nucleosome-depleted and accessible chromatin state typical of normal regulatory elements, and this is believed to facilitate further transcription factor binding events. more...

40. Identification of intrinsic growth modulators for intact CNS neurons after injury
(Submitter supplied) Functional deficits persist after spinal cord injury (SCI) because axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate. However, modest levels of spontaneous functional recovery are typically observed after trauma, and are thought to be mediated by the plasticity of intact circuits. The mechanisms underlying intact circuit plasticity are not delineated. Here, we characterize the in vivo transcriptome of sprouting intact neurons from ngr1 null mice after partial SCI. more...

Whether the constitutive activity of these two groups of cis-regulatory elements relies on entirely distinct or instead shared regulators is unknown. By dissecting the cis-regulatory repertoire of macrophages, we found that the ELF subfamily of ETS proteins selectively bound within 60 bp from the transcription start sites of highly active housekeeping genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The Gfi1-Cre mouse is commonly used for conditional hair cell-specific gene deletion/activation in the inner ear. However, we have shown that these mice produce a pattern of recombination that is not strictly limited to hair cells, and that Gfi1cre/+  mice exhibit an early onset progressive hearing loss as compared with their wildtype littermates. Here we performed a transcriptome analysis of Gfi1cre/+ and Gfi1+/+ cochlea to detect potential changes in gene expression that could contribute to their hearing loss phenotype, or that could potentially confound downstream analysis of conditional gene deletion using these mice.

We further discover that the loss of maternal SALL4 causes failure in establishment of DNA methylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that SALL4 modulates H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications by regulating the expression of Kdm5b, Kdm6a and Kdm6b. more...

69. Investigating the role of retinol dehydrogenase 10 in the retina visual cycle
(Submitter supplied) Rapid pigment regeneration is critical for the continuous function of cone photoreceptors in bright and rapidly-changing light conditions throughout the day. This process is made possible in part by the recently-characterized retina visual cycle, in which retinal Müller cells recycle spent all-trans retinol visual chromophore to 11-cis retinol and supply it to cones.  As only cone photoreceptors, but not rods, can oxidize 11-cis retinol to the 11-cis retinal used for pigment regeneration, this reaction is believed to render the retina visual cycle cone-specific. more...

(Submitter supplied) Histone variant H3.3 is incorporated into various chromatin domains by distinct chaperones including HIRA, ASF1A, ATRX and DAXX. We have shown that a pool of neo-synthesized H3.3 is recruited to PML bodies (NBs) before deposition into chromatin. In PML NBs H3.3 is colocalized with DAXX, ATRX, HIRA and ASF1A, suggesting a view of PML NBs acting as regulatory centers of H3.3 loading. Here we by assess the impact of PML on the association of epitope-tagged H3.3 with chromatin. more...

(Submitter supplied) The heat shock response (HSR) is a mechanism to cope with proteotoxic stress by inducing the expression of molecular chaperones and other heat shock response genes. The HSR is evolutionarily well conserved and has been widely studied in bacteria, cell lines and lower eukaryotic model organisms. However, mechanistic insights into the HSR in higher eukaryotes, in particular in mammals, are limited. We have developed an in vivo heat shock protocol to analyze the HSR in mice and dissected heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-dependent and -independent pathways. more...

92. A label-retaining but unipotent cell population resides in biliary compartment of mammalian liver.
(Submitter supplied) Cells with slow proliferation kinetics that retain the nuclear label over long time periods – the label-retaining cells (LRCs) – represent multipotent stem cells in a number of adult tissues. Since the identity of liver LRCs (LLRCs) had remained elusive we utilized a genetic approach to reveal LLRCs in normal non-injured livers and characterized their regenerative properties in vivo and in culture. We found that LLRCs were located in biliary vessels and participated in the regeneration of biliary but not hepatocyte injury. In culture experiments the sorted LLRCs displayed an enhanced self-renewal capacity but a unipotent biliary differentiation potential. Transcriptome analysis revealed a unique set of tumorigenesis- and nervous system-related genes upregulated in LLRCs when compared to non-LRC cholangiocytes. We conclude that the LLRCs established during the normal morphogenesis of the liver do not represent a multipotent primitive somatic stem cell population but act as unipotent biliary progenitor cells.

(Submitter supplied) Synaptic activity drives changes in gene expression to promote long-lasting adaptations of neuronal structure and function. One example of such an adaptive response is the buildup of acquired neuroprotection, a synaptic activity- and gene transcription-mediated increase in the resistance of neurons against harmful conditions. A hallmark of acquired neuroprotection is the stabilization of mitochondrial structure and function. more...

109. Exhaustion-associated regulatory regions in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (anti-PD-L1 vs Control IgG RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function and memory potential due to persistent antigen exposure, which occurs in chronic viral infections and cancer. Here we investigate the relation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that recognize a model tumor antigen and have features of both activation and functional exhaustion. By filtering out accessible regions observed in bystander, non-exhausted, TIL and in acutely restimulated CD8+ T cells, we define a pattern of chromatin accessibility specific for T cell exhaustion, characterized by enrichment for consensus binding motifs for Nr4a and NFAT transcription factors. Anti-PD-L1 treatment of tumor-bearing mice results in cessation of tumor growth and partial rescue of cytokine production by the dysfunctional TIL, with only limited changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our studies provide a valuable resource for the molecular understanding of T cell exhaustion in cancer and other inflammatory settings.

137. Dietary restriction protects from age-associated DNA methylation and induces epigenetic reprogramming of lipid metabolism
(Submitter supplied) Dietary restriction (DR), a reduction in food intake without malnutrition, increases most aspects of health during ageing and extends lifespan in diverse species including rodents and rhesus monkeys. However the mechanisms by which DR interacts with the ageing process to improve health at old age are poorly understood. DNA methylation could play an important role in mediating the effects of DR, because it is sensitive to the effects of nutrition and can affect gene expression memory over time. more...

(Submitter supplied) ASXL1 is frequently mutated in a spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis. Loss of Asxl1 leads to myelodysplastic syndrome-like disease in mice, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that ASXL1 interacts with the cohesin complex, which has been shown to guide sister chromotid segregation and to regulate gene expression. Loss of Asxl1 impairs the cohesin function as reflected by an impaired telophase chromatid disjunction in hematopoietic cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Particularly in the context of differentiation and development, the importance of three-dimensional chromatin architecture to gene regulatory mechanisms is becoming increasingly clear.  The most ancient known mechanism of chromatin organization involves TFIIIC, a transcription factor (TF) that recruits RNA polymerase III (Pol III) for transcription of tRNA and other types of non-coding RNA genes. From yeast to mammals, TFIIIC binds to tRNA genes (tDNAs) and scattered “extra-TFIIIC” (ETC) loci and serves to tether these loci together as anchors of chromatin loops. more...

166. Converting adult pancreatic α-cells into β-cells by targeting Dnmt1 and Arx
(Submitter supplied) After their destruction in adult mice, insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells slowly regenerate from other islet cells, like glucagon-producing alpha-cells. However the molecular basis of this conversion is unknown. Moreover it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell conversion is relevant to human diseases with extensive beta-cell loss, like in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we show that subsets of glucagon-expressing cells in subjects with T1D produce Insulin and other molecular features of beta-cells, accompanied by loss of the alpha-cell regulators DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) and Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx). more...

173. Analysis of transcriptional and epigentic changes induced by loss of Phf8 [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Phf8 is a histone demethylase with links to human behavior. Here we have performed a transcriptional analysis of Phf8 knockout embryonic stem and neural projenitor cells in vitro along with an analysis of the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in vivo. Our results suggest that knockout of Phf8 is largely compensated for. However, we did observe a misregulation of serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex, which may have disease implications.

(Submitter supplied) Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p-) is one of the most critical genetic variants used in B-CLL risk stratification. The tumor suppressor TP53 maps to this region, and its loss or mutation significantly accelerates B-CLL progression, hampers response to chemotherapy, and shortens survival. While florescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for 17p deletions are routinely performed during clinical diagnoses, mutational analyses of the TP53 gene is not widely available and thus its mutational status is often unknown in patients with CLL. more...

240. RNA-seq of Tumor-associated Endothelial Cells from Different Immunodeficient Backgrounds
(Submitter supplied) To investigate the impact of CD4+ T cells on tumor vasculature, we performed transcriptome profiling on tumor-associated endothelial cells in mice with or without functional CD4 T cells. In addition to examining four pathways that affect vessel maturation (VEGFA, ANGPT1/ANGPT2, TGFbR, and sphingolipid metabolism), we ran Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and found a down-regulation of cellular adhesion and extracellular matrix assembly-related pathways in the CD4 T cell deficient group. more...

241. Role of transcriptional coregulator GRIP1 in control of macrophage polarization and metabolic homeostasis
(Submitter supplied) Diet-induced obesity is characterized by macrophage (MΦ) infiltration and low-grade chronic inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) leading to insulin resistance. WAT MΦ are highly heterogeneous in their origin, patterns of gene expression and activities: unlike infiltrating monocyte-derived MΦ that promote inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, tissue-resident WAT MΦ originally described as ‘M2’ are phenotypically anti-inflammatory and counteract obesity and insulin resistance. more...

242. An intrinsic transcriptional program underlying synaptic scaling during activity suppression
(Submitter supplied) Homeostatic scaling allows neurons to maintain stable activity patterns by globally altering their synaptic strength in response to changing activity levels. Suppression of activity by blocking action potentials increases synaptic strength through an upregulation of surface AMPA receptors. Although this synaptic up-scaling was shown to require transcription, the molecular nature of the intrinsic transcription program underlying this process and its functional significance have been unclear. more...

244. Dynamic DNA methylation landscape defines brown and white cell specificity during adipogenesis (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) We depicted a genome-wide integrative view of DNA methylome by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and transcriptome by RNA-seq during brown and white adipocyte differentiation. Our analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic signature for brown and white cell lineage before, during and after differentiation. When comparing white to brown adipocytes at all three time points of differentiation, we identified five members of the Hox family whose expression levels were anti-correlated with promoter methylation, suggesting a regulatory role of DNA methylation in transcription.

246. Molecular role of the PAX5-ETV6 oncoprotein in promoting B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Submitter supplied) PAX5 is a tumor suppressor in B-ALL, while the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in B-ALL development is largely unknown. Here we studied the function of PAX5-ETV6 and PAX5- FOXP1 in mice expressing these proteins from the Pax5 locus. Both proteins arrested Blymphopoiesis at the pro-B-to-pre-B cell transition and, contrary to their proposed dominantnegative role, did not interfere with the expression of most Pax5 target genes. more...

248. Loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor function in a mouse model of BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL correlates with a developmental block at a highly proliferative stage
(Submitter supplied) Deletions within the human IKZF1 gene, which encodes Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor critical for lymphopoiesis, appear to be the most prominent recurring lesion in human BCR-ABL1+ (Ph+) B-ALL. Furthermore, IKZF1 mutations correlate with poor prognosis of progenitor B-ALL, further strengthening the notion that IKZF1 is a critical tumor suppressor gene in human B-lineage malignancies. To better understand the relationship between Ikzf1 mutations, BCR-ABL, and B-lineage leukemia, we examined the effect of two newly generated Ikzf1 germline mutation on BCR-ABL-induced proliferation and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo. more...

249. Comprehensive characterization of neutrophil genome topology
(Submitter supplied) Neutrophils are responsible for the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Their nuclei are uniquely structured as multiple lobes that establish a highly constrained nuclear environment. Here we found that neutrophil genomes were depleted of local genomic interactions but enriched for long-range genomic interactions that spanned multiple topologically associating domains. Population-based simulation of spherical and torroid genomes revealed declining radii of gyration for neutrophil chromosomes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Increasingly, studies have shown that mature spermatozoa contain many transcripts including mRNAs and miRNAs. However, the expression profile of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian sperm has not been systematically investigated. Here, we used highly purified RNA to investigate lncRNA expression profiles in mouse mature sperm by stranded-specific RNA-seq. We identified 20907 known and 4088 novel lncRNAs transcripts, and the existence of intact lncRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization on two representative lncRNAs. more...

295. Single cell transcriptome sequencing of mammary stem cells in the pubertal mammary gland
(Submitter supplied) The mammary gland is a highly dynamic organ that mainly develops during puberty. Based on morphology and proliferation analysis, mammary stem cells (MaSCs) are thought to be close to or reside in the terminal end buds (TEBs) during pubertal development. However, exclusive stem cell markers are lacking, and therefore the true identity of MaSCs, including their location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate during branching morphogenesis, has yet to be defined. more...

296. Distinct roles for motif affinity, chromatin state, and co-regulatory motifs in PPARγ binding and enhancer activity
(Submitter supplied) Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to cognate motifs in promoters and enhancers. However, predicting genomic TF binding events and their quantitative contribution to expression remains a major challenge. In principle, the binding and enhancer activity of specific sites in vivo might depend on: (i) latent properties of the motif instance, (ii) cooperative interactions with other TFs that bind in the immediate vicinity, and (iii) the chromatin state of the sites in the genome. more...

308. Not All H3K4 methylations are Created Equal: Mll2/COMPASS Dependency in Primordial Germ Cell Specification
(Submitter supplied) The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is central for cell-lineage specification during embryonic development and is achieved through the combinatorial action of transcription factors/co-factors and the epigenetic states at cis-regulatory elements. Previously, we reported that Mll2 (KMT2B)/COMPASS is responsible for the implementation of H3K4me3 at promoters of bivalent genes. Here, we show that Mll2/COMPASS can also implements H3K4me3 at some of the non-TSS regulatory elements, a subset of which share epigenetic signatures of active enhancers. more...

309. Multilayered control of alternative splicing regulatory networks by transcription factors (SPAR-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Networks of coordinated alternative splicing (AS) events play critical roles in development and disease. However, a comprehensive knowledge of the factors that regulate these networks is lacking. We describe a high-throughput system for systematically linking trans-acting factors to endogenous RNA regulation events. Using this system, we identify hundreds of factors associated with diverse regulatory layers that positively or negatively control AS events linked to cell fate. more...

312. Subpopulations of mouse beta cells
(Submitter supplied) Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that involves immune mediated destruction of β cells. How β cells respond to immune attack is unknown. We identified a population of β cells during the progression of T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that survives immune attack. This population develops from normal β cells confronted with islet infiltrates. Pathways involving cell movement, growth and proliferation, immune responses, and cell death and survival are activated in these cells. more...

317. Intergenerational programming of hepatic xenobiotic response by paternal Nicotine exposure
(Submitter supplied) Although it is increasingly accepted that some paternal environmental conditions can influence phenotypes in future generations, it generally remains unclear whether the phenotypes induced in offspring represent specific responses to particular aspects of the paternal exposure history, or whether they represent a more generic response to paternal “quality of life”. To establish a paternal effect model based on a known ligand-receptor interaction and thereby enable pharmacological interrogation of the specificity of the offspring response, we explored the effects of paternal nicotine administration on offspring phenotype in mouse. more...

321. RNA-seq analysis of Akt1-mediated muscle growth
(Submitter supplied) Background: Skeletal muscle constitutes a significant portion of total body mass and is a major regulator of systemic metabolism as it serves as the major site for glucose disposal and the main reservoir for amino acids. With aging, cachexia, starvation, and myositis, there is a preferential loss of fast glycolytic muscle fibers. We previously reported a mouse model in which a constitutively-active Akt transgene is induced to express in a subset of muscle groups leading to the hypertrophy of type IIb myofibers with an accompanying increase in strength. more...

343. Macrophage transcriptional profile identifies lipid catabolic pathways that can be therapeutically targeted after spinal cord injury
(Submitter supplied) We used the RiboTag method to obtain macrophage-specific mRNA directly from injured spinal cord and performed RNA sequencing to investigate the translational profiles. Our data show that macrophages at 3 days after SCI are enriched in genes related to cell migration and cytokine signaling. However, at 7 days, lipid catabolism represents the main biological process, and we identify canonical nuclear receptor pathways as potential mediators of lipid catabolism in macrophages.

345. Global and Targeted DNA Demethylation during iPSC Reprogramming
(Submitter supplied) Global DNA demethylation occurs in vivo in the early embryo and primordial germ cells, and in vitro during the transition of primed embryonic stem cells (ESC) to naïve pluripotency. Whether such global reprogramming also occurs in the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is not known. We show that iPSC reprogramming involves two modes of DNA demethylation – global and targeted. Cells at intermediate stages of reprogramming undergo genome-wide demethylation. more...

Here, we show that the transcription factors IRF1 and BATF are induced early during treatment with IL-27 and are required for the differentiation and function of Tr1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Epigenetic and transcriptional analyses reveal that both transcription factors influence chromatin accessibility and expression of genes required for Tr1 cell function. more...

350. The long intergenic non-coding RNA CCR492 functions as a let-7 competitive endogenous RNA to regulate c-Myc expression
(Submitter supplied) The cell cycle progression through the G1 phase is a tightly regulated process mediated by the transcriptional activation of early genes in response to mitogenic stimuli, whose dysregulation often leads to tumorigenesis. We here report the discovery by RNA-seq of cell cycle regulated (CCR) long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), potentially involved in the control of the cell cycle progression. We identified 10 new lincRNAs whose expression was induced in response to serum treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and in Balb/c fibroblasts, comparably to early genes. By loss-of-function experiments we found that lincRNA CCR492 is required for cell cycle progression, localizes in the cell cytoplasm and contains 4 let-7 miRNA recognition elements (MREs). Mechanistically, CCR492 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to antagonize the function of Let-7 microRNA, leading to the de-repression of c-Myc. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of CCR492 along with a constitutively active H-Ras triggers cell transformation. In brief, we found a novel lincRNA that regulates c-Myc expression, is required for efficient progression of the cell cycle, and whose deregulation contributes to tumour growth.

352. Genetic Redundancy of GATA Factors in Extraembryonic Trophoblast Lineage Ensures Progression of both Pre and Postimplantation Mammalian Development [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) GATA transcription factors are implicated in establishing cell fate during mammalian development. In early mammalian embryos, GATA3 is selectively expressed in the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage and regulates gene expression to promote trophoblast fate. However, trophoblast-specific GATA3 function is dispensable for early mammalian development. Here, using dual conditional knockout mice, we show that genetic redundancy of GATA3 with paralog GATA2 in trophoblast progenitors ensures the successful progression of both pre and postimplantation mammalian development. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in a wide variety of regulatory pathways in mammalian cells. Here, we report that the DEAD-box RBP DDX5 (also known as p68) inhibits induced pluripotency by negatively regulating the expression and function of a non-canonical polycomb complex 1 (PRC1) subunit, RYBP, by modulating microRNA-125b processing. DDX5 loss-of-function, both during reprogramming and the somatic to pluripotent transition, and also in the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, results in the suppression of lineage-specific genes via an RYBP-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2A at K119 (H2AK119ub1). more...

377. The mammalian LINC complex controls mechanosensing at a genome-wide level: RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) Mechanical cues influence the shape, growth, and function of tissues and organs and are necessary for the development of engineered tissues. Yet, how cells sense mechanical cues and transduce them into changes in gene expression is not well understood. It is known that mechanical forces transmitted to the nucleus induce chromatin remodeling, promote DNA repair, contribute to the motion of intranuclear organelles and cause direct dissociation of protein complexes inside nuclei. more...

378. Pervasive translational regulation of the cell Q1 signalling circuitry underlies mammalian development
(Submitter supplied) The degree and dynamics of translational control during mammalian development remain poorly understood. Here we monitored translation of the mammalian genome as cells become specified and organize into tissues in vivo. This identified unexpected and pervasive translational regulation of most of the core signalling circuitry including Shh,Wnt, Hippo, PI3K and MAPK pathways. We further identify and functionally characterize a complex landscape of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) across 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of key signalling components. more...

(Submitter supplied) Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM) reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency. To gain a mechanistic understanding of their function, we mapped OSKM-binding, stage-specific transcription-factors (TFs), and chromatin-states in discrete reprogramming stages and performed loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We found that early in reprogramming OSK extensively bind somatic-enhancers and initiate their decommissioning by recruiting Hdac1. more...

Here we identified an essential role of the transcription factor Bhlhe41, with a lesser contribution of Bhlhe40, in controlling late stages of B-1a cell differentiation. Bhlhe41/Bhlhe40 mutant B-1a cells were strongly reduced and had an abnormal cell-surface phenotype and altered B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, as exemplified by loss of the phosphatidylcholine-specific Vh12/Vk4 BCR. more...

(Submitter supplied) We used RNA-seq to compare the gene expression profiles of adult mouse prostate luminal cells and luminal cells that have the androgen receptor (AR) gene deleted. Our analyses show that AR-null luminal cells have altered expression levels of genes involved in cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton regulation, and MAPK and TGF-beta signaling pathways. These results are consistent with our finding that AR-null luminal cells have abnormal cell morphology and loss of cell polarity.

(Submitter supplied) The TGF-β superfamily member Nodal triggers mesendoderm differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. This transition however requires cooperating Wnt signaling inputs. Here we report that p53, a powerful tumor suppressor in adult tissues, orchestrates this cooperation. We show that p53, which is released from inhibition as mouse ES cells exit from pluripotency, acts as a direct inducer of Wnt3 expression. more...

Here,  using intrathymic transfers with fetal and adult progenitor cells, in conjunction with gene expression profiling and functional assays, we demonstrate that because neonatal CD8+ T cells are derived from a distinct progenitor cell population, they behave differently than adult cells from the time they are generated. more...

In order to understand the mechanism underlying this heterogeneity, we conducted single cell transcriptome analysis on BFU-E cells purified from mouse embryos. more...

Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. more...

However, surprisingly, only a subset of genes is altered in their expression following knockdown of H2B ubiquitin-protein ligases RNF20 or RNF40 in human cells. In order to obtain a more complete genome- and transcriptome-wide understanding of the role of H2Bub1 in gene transcription, we generated tamoxifen-inducible Rnf40 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). more...

Here we document that BTBD18 is a pachytene nuclear protein in mouse testes that occupies intergenic pachytene piRNA-producing loci with remarkable genome-wide specificity. Deficiency of Btbd18 in mice results in disrupted piRNA biogenesis and male sterility. more...

(Submitter supplied) The molecular pathways and microenvironmental cues that choreograph the conversion of endothelial cells (ECs) into true engraftable haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain undefined. This is due to lack of models to recreate the ephemeral transition from endothelial to haemogenic cells and to HSCs. Here, we have developed a novel sequential in vitro model in which by precise conditional sequential on-off expression of transcription factors: FosB, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (FGRS); and re-establishing a proper inductive vascular niche, we were able to reprogram adult mouse ECs into HSCs (rEC-HSCs) over a 28 day period. more...

(Submitter supplied) The most frequent focal alterations in human retinoblastoma are RB mutation and MYCN amplification. Whether MYCN overexpression drives retinoblastoma has not been assessed in model systems. Here, we show that Rb inactivation collaborates strongly with MYCN overexpression to lead to retinoblastoma in mice. MYCN overexpression in the context of Rb inactivation increased the expression of MYC, E2F and ribosome related gene sets, promoted excessive proliferation and led to retinoblastoma with anaplastic changes. more...

Myelin is turned over and adapted throughout life; however, the molecular and cellular basis of myelin dynamics is not well understood. Hypothesizing that only a fraction of all myelin-related mRNAs has been identified so far, we subjected myelin biochemically purified from mouse brains at various ages to RNA sequencing. more...

480. Foxa2 and Cdx2 cooperate with Nkx2-1 to inhibit lung adenocarcinoma metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Despite the fact that the majority of lung cancer deaths are due to metastasis, the molecular mechanisms driving metastat    ic progression are poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that loss of Foxa2 and Cdx2 synergizes with loss of Nkx2-    1 to fully activate the metastatic program. These three lineage-specific transcription factors are consistently downregul    ated in metastatic cells compared to non-metastatic cells. more...

483. Dicer maintains the identity and function of proprioceptive sensory neurons
(Submitter supplied) During development neurons achieve a high degree of specialization (Fishell and Heintz, 2013). Over time, while continuously recycling their components and despite transcriptional noise, their own respective properties remain intact. The transcription factors that play a large role in initially establishing neuronal identity can be required for maintaining it (Deneris and Hobert, 2014). Post-transcriptional regulation is also important to differentiation (Bian and Sun, 2011) but its role in maintaining cell identity is less established. more...

(Submitter supplied) Internal bases in mRNA can be subjected to modifications that influence the fate of mRNA in cells. One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5′ end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. more...

513. Clonal conversion of B-lymphoid leukemia reveals cross-lineage transfer of malignant states.
(Submitter supplied) Even though leukemia is considered as confined to one specific hematopoietic cell type, cases of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and patients relapsing in phenotypically altered disease suggest that a malignant state may be transferred between lineages. Because B-cell leukemia is associated with mutations in transcription factors of importance for stable preservation of lineage identity we here investigated the potential lineage plasticity of leukemic cells. more...

The genetic network driving posterior axial elongation in mice, and its disturbance in mutants with posterior truncation are not yet fully understood. We show that the combined expression of Cdx2 and T Brachyury is essential to establish the core signature of posterior axial progenitors. more...

548. HOX13 activity reprograms cis-regulatory modules during digit development (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The combinatorial expression of the Hox genes along the body axes, referred to as the HOX code, is a major determinant of cell fate and plays a prevailing role in generating the animal body plan. In developing limb buds, the paralogous group 13 genes of the HoxA and HoxD clusters are essential for patterning the distal-most limb structures, the digits. Inactivation of HOXA13 and HOXD13 transcription factors (HOX13) leads to complete digit agenesis in mice, but how HOX13 regulate transcriptional outcomes and confer identity to the distal-most limb cells has remained elusive. more...

555. TADs emerge as a functionally, but not structurally privileged scale in the hierarchical folding of chromosomes
(Submitter supplied) Understanding how regulatory sequences interact in the context of chromosomal architecture is a central challenge in biology. Chromosome conformation capture revealed that mammalian chromosomes possess a rich hierarchy of structural layers, from multi-megabase compartments to sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs), and further down to sub-TAD loop domains. TADs appear to act as regulatory microenvironments by constraining and segregating regulatory interactions across discrete chromosomal regions. more...

(Submitter supplied) The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) stimulates resting metabolic rate in part through a mechanism involving suppression of the circulating RAS.  This effect appears to be mediated through a reduction in  angiotensin AT2 receptor (AT2R) signaling within inguinal fat.  To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, mice with hyperactivity of the brain RAS (“sRA” mice, expressing human renin via the synapsin promoter and human angiotensinogen via its own promoter) and littermate controls were chronically infused with vehicle or the AT2R specific agonist, CGP-42112a (CGP, 90 ng/hr, 8 wk, sc). more...

In striated muscle, the identity of these cells becomes important in disease when ECM changes result in fibrosis and subsequent increased tissue stiffness and dysfunction. Here we describe a novel approach to isolate and identify cells that maintain ECM niches in both healthy and fibrotic muscle. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cultured pluripotent stem cells are a cornerstone of regenerative medicine due to their ability to give rise to all cell types of the body. While pluripotent stem cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, pluripotency is paradoxically a very transient state in vivo, lasting 2-3 days around the time of blastocyst implantation. The exception to this rule is embryonic diapause, a reversible state of suspended development triggered by unfavorable conditions. more...

(Submitter supplied) Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play critical roles in liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation in HSC inhibits liver inflammation and fibrosis. Here we show that p62/SQSTM1, a protein that is upregulated in liver parenchymal cells but downregulated in HCC-associated HSC, negatively regulates HSC activation. Total body or HSC-specific p62 ablation potentiates HSC activation and enhances inflammation, fibrosis and HCC progression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Nucleosome organization influences gene activity by controlling DNA accessibility to transcription machinery. Here, we develop a chemical biology approach to determine mammalian nucleosome positions genome-wide. Using this strategy, we uncover surprising new features of nucleosome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the prevailing model, we observe that for nearly all mouse genes a class of fragile nucleosomes occupies previously designated nucleosome-depleted regions around transcription start sites and transcription termination sites. more...

(Submitter supplied) p62/SQSTM1 is a ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptor and signaling protein that  accumulates in premalignant liver diseases and most hepatocellular carcinomas  (HCC). Although p62 was proposed to participate in formation of benign adenomas in  autophagy-deficient livers, its role in HCC initiation was not explored. Here we show  that p62 is necessary and sufficient for HCC induction in mice and that its high  expression level in non-tumor human liver predicts rapid HCC recurrence after curative  ablation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Uterine glands are essential for pregnancy in mice and likely humans, because they secrete or transport bioactive substances that regulate uterine receptivity for blastocyst implantation. In mice, the uterus becomes receptive to blastocyst implantation on day 4, but is refractory by day 5. Here, blastocysts could be recovered from progesterone-induced uterine gland (PUGKO) but not wildtype (WT) mice on day 5 post-mating. more...

Connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx45 are co-expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, form gap junctions and are considered to exhibit adhesive function and/or to contribute to the establishment of defined communication compartments. Here we describe the generation of Cx43/Cx45-double deficient mouse ES cells to achieve almost complete breakdown of GJIC. more...

692. p53 is a critical regulator of airway epithelial progenitor cell homeostasis.
(Submitter supplied) How progenitor cells regulate quiescence and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates both proliferation and differentiation of club progenitor cells in the airway epithelium. We show that p53 loss decreases ciliated cell differentiation and increases the proliferative capacity of club progenitors, increasing epithelial cell density. p53 deficient progenitors generated a pseudostratified epithelium containing basal-like cells in vitro and contained an increased proportion of BASCs in vivo, suggesting that p53 suppresses multipotency during homeostasis. more...

ARCAgRP neurons release GABA, NPY and the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) antagonist, AgRP, and are activated by fasting1-4.  When stimulated, they rapidly and potently drive hunger5,6.  ARCPOMC neurons, in contrast, release the MC4R agonist, α-MSH, and are viewed as the counterpoint to ARCAgRP neurons.  They are regulated in an opposite fashion and their activity leads to decreased hunger2,4,7. more...

Here we investigate the role of TNFR2 in microglia and peripheral monocyte/macrophages in EAE using novel cell-specific conditional knockouts. We show that microglial TNFR2 ablation leads to early onset of EAE, with increased CNS leucocyte infiltration, T cell activation, and demyelination. more...

697. Tet-dependent transcriptional programs during mESC differentiation
(Submitter supplied) Tet-family dioxygenases catalyze conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA. Here, we show that Tet3 deficiency impairs neural differentiation of mouse ESCs, resulting in skewing towards cardiac mesoderm; conversely, ectopic expression of Tet3 enhances neural differentiation and limits cardiac mesoderm specification. To determine the effects of Tet3 gain and loss on global gene expression profiles during mESC differentiation, we performed whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of (i) WT and Tet3 KO mESCs differentiating into neuroectoderm under SFEB culture (days 6 and 10); and (ii) Control and Tet3-overexpressing mESCs in non-permissive neural differentiation conditions containing FBS (days 4 and 7). more...

717. Misregulation of an activity-dependent splicing network as a common mechanism underlying autism spectrum disorders
(Submitter supplied) A key challenge in understanding and ultimately treating autism is to identify common molecular mechanisms underlying this genetically heterogeneous disorder. Transcriptomic profiling of autistic brains has revealed correlated misregulation of the neuronal splicing regulator nSR100/SRRM4 and its target microexon splicing program in more than one-third of analyzed individuals. To investigate whether nSR100 misregulation is causally linked to autism, we generated mutant mice with reduced levels of this protein and its target splicing program. more...

720. Distinct roles of transcription factors KLF4, Krox20 and PPARg in adipogenesis
(Submitter supplied) Much of our knowledge on adipogenesis comes from cell culture models of preadipocyte differentiation. Adipogenesis is induced by treating confluent preadipocytes with the adipogenic cocktail, which activates transcription factors (TFs) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CREB within minutes and increases expression of TFs C/EBPb/d, KLF4 and Krox20 within hours. All of these TFs have been shown to be capable of promoting adipogenesis in culture when they are overexpressed. more...

722. EPOP interacts with Elongin BC and USP7 to modulate the chromatin landscape (EPOP KO)
(Submitter supplied) Gene regulatory networks are pivotal for many biological processes. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) the transcriptional network can be divided into three functionally distinct modules: Polycomb, Core and Myc. The Polycomb module represses developmental genes, while the Myc module is associated with proliferative functions and its mis-regulation is linked to cancer development. Here, we show that in mESCs the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) associated protein EPOP (a.k.a C17orf96, esPRC2p48, E130012A19Rik) co-localizes at chromatin with members of the Myc and Polycomb module. more...

However, it is unclear what the physiological functions of AhR in B cells are. We show here that expression of Ahr in B cells is up-regulated upon B cell receptor (BCR) engagement and IL-4 treatment. Addition of a natural ligand of AhR, FICZ, induces AhR translocation to the nucleus and transcription of the AhR target gene Cyp1a1, showing that the AhR pathway is functional in B cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mutations in spliceosome genes occur in the bone marrow of approximately 50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), with mutations in the splicing factor gene U2AF1 found in ~11% of MDS patients. We hypothesized that cells harboring a spliceosome gene mutation would have increased sensitivity to further perturbation of the spliceosome by splicing modulator drugs. To examine the effects of the splicing modulator drug sudemycin D6 on primary hematopoietic cells expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F), we treated transgenic mice expressing either mutant U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(wildtype, WT) concurrently with 5 days of sudemycin D6 treatment in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) BCAS2 (Breast cancer amplified sequence 2) is involved in multiple biological processes, including pre-mRNA splicing. However, the physiological roles of BCAS2 are still largely unclear. Here we report that BCAS2 is specifically enriched in spermatogonia of mouse testes. Conditional disruption of Bcas2 in male germ cells impairs spermatogenesis and leads to male mouse infertility. Although the spermatogonia appear grossly normal, spermatocytes in meiosis prophase I and meiosis events (recombination and synapsis) are rarely observed in the BCAS2-depleted testis. more...

742. A model of breast cancer heterogeneity reveals vascular mimicry as a driver of metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2   5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. more...

743. Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor derived from CD4+ T cells aids in control of an intracellular infection [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Background: In malaria, parasites of the genus Plasmodium elicit robust host expansion of macrophages and monocytes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In a microarray analysis of pooled, activated CD4+ T cells from mice infected with P. chabaudi, we detected inducible expression of Csf1, which promotes macrophage proliferation. To better characterize Csf1-producing T cells, single-cell RNA-Seq was performed. more...

(Submitter supplied) Embryonic gene expression intricately reflects anatomical context, developmental stage, and cell type. To address whether the precise spatial origins of cardiac cells can be deduced solely from their transcriptional profiles, we established a genome-wide expression database from 118, 949, and 1166 single murine heart cells at embryonic days (e)8.5, 9.5, and 10.5, respectively. We segregated these cells by type using unsupervised bioinformatic analysis and identified novel chamber-specific genes. more...

747. Macrophage ontogeny underlies differences in tumor-specific education in brain malignancies
(Submitter supplied) Recent efforts have uncovered immense transcriptional and ontogenetic diversity among tissue-resident macrophages, each with their own transcriptional profile endowing the cell with its tissue-specific functions. However, it is currently unknown whether the origins of different macrophage populations may affect their roles in malignancy. Given potential artifacts associated with irradiation-based lineage tracing, it remains unclear if bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) are even present in tumors of the brain, a tissue where there is no homeostatic involvement of peripherally-derived myeloid cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tightly regulated in the immune system, as aberrant expression of miRNAs often results in hematopoietic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Previously, elevated levels of miR-27 in T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients has been suggested to facilitate disease progression through inhibiting Th2 immunity and promoting pathogenic Th1 responses. Here we demonstrate that while mice with T cell-specific overexpression of miR-27 harbor dysregulated Th1 responses and develop autoimmune pathology, these disease phenotypes are not driven by miR-27 in effector T cells in a cell-autonomous manner but rather resulted from a perturbed regulatory T (Treg) cell compartment. more...

778. Cell type-specific chromatin states differentially prime squamous cell carcinoma tumor-initiating cells for epithelial to mesenchymal transition [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells has been associated with metastasis, stemness and resistance to therapy. The reason why some tumors undergo EMT and other not might reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin, although this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show cell type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime tumors to EMT. more...

Our ability to investigate the roles of individual subsets is limited by an absence of approaches to ablate gene function within specific sub-populations. Using Nr4a1-dependent Ly6Clow monocytes as a representative cell type we show that enhancer deletion addresses these limitations. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we report a key role for the transcription factor Pax6 in the maintenance of adult beta-cell identity and function. Pax6 is down regulated in beta-cells of diabetic db/db mice and in wild type mice treated with an insulin receptor antagonist, revealing metabolic control of expression. Deletion of Pax6 in beta-cells of adult mice leads to lethal hyperglycemia and ketosis, due to loss of beta-cell function and expansion of alpha-cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Microtubule actin crosslinking factor 1 (Macf1) plays a role in coordinated actions of actin and microtubules in multiple cellular processes. Here we show that Macf1 is also critical for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types. Ablation of Macf1 in the developing retina abolishes ciliogenesis and basal bodies fail to dock to ciliary vesicles or migrate apically. Photoreceptor polarity is randomized while inner retinal cells laminate correctly, suggesting that photoreceptor maturation is guided by polarity cues provided by cilia. more...

Comparison of mRNA profiles between ISCs grown in Matrigel and non-degradable PEG show no major differences in expression of gene related to stemness, proliferation and signaling via the Wnt and Notch pathways. These results also show that ISC cultured in degradable PEG matrices upregulate stress- and inflammation-related genes compared with cells expanded in non-degradable PEG matrices.

811. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of bacterial lipoprotein-induced polyploid macrophages.
(Submitter supplied) Granulomas are immune cell aggregates formed in response to persistent inflammatory stimuli. Granuloma macrophage subsets are diverse and carry varying copy numbers of their genomic information. The molecular programs that control the differentiation of such macrophage populations in response to a chronic stimulus, though critical for disease outcome, have not been defined. In this study, we performed scRNA-Seq experiments to gain insights into the transcriptional regulation of polyploid macrophage differentiation in response to chronically persistent inflammatory stimuli.

812. Snai2 and Snai3 transcriptionally regulate cellular fitness and functionality of T cell lineages through distinct gene programs
(Submitter supplied) T lymphocytes are essential contributors to the adaptive immune system and consist of multiple lineages that serve various effector and regulatory roles.  As such, precise control of gene expression is essential to the proper development and function of these cells.  Previously, we identified Snai2 and Snai3 as being essential regulators of immune tolerance partly due to the impaired function of CD4+ regulatory T cells in Snai2/3 conditional double knockout mice. more...

816. Local regulation of gene expression by lncRNA promoters, transcription, and splicing
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of spliced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose functions remain poorly understood. Because recent evidence has implicated several specific lncRNA loci in the local regulation of gene expression, we sought to determine whether such local regulation is a property of many lncRNA loci. We used genetic manipulations to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and found that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighboring gene in cis. more...

819. Impact of miRNA Levels, Target-Site Complementarity and Cooperativity on ceRNA-Regulated Gene Expression
(Submitter supplied) Expression changes of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have been proposed to influence microRNA (miRNA) activity and thereby regulate other transcripts that contain miRNA binding sites. Here, we find that although miRNA levels define the extent of repression, they do not affect the magnitude of the ceRNA expression change required to observe derepression. Canonical 6-nt sites, which typically mediate modest repression, can nonetheless compete for miRNA binding, with potency ~20% of that observed for canonical 8-nt sites. more...

(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) in situ represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration.  A combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT), can convert fibroblasts into iCMs, albeit with low efficiency in vitro. Here, we screened 5,500 compounds in primary cardiac fibroblasts and found that a combination of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β inhibitor SB431542 and the WNT inhibitor XAV939 increased reprogramming efficiency eight-fold when added to GMT-overexpressing cardiac fibroblasts. more...

(Submitter supplied) To capture the Zeb2-dependent transcriptional changes in early cell state/fate decisions we performed RNA-seq on Zeb2 control and Zeb2 knockout cells. We chose three stages, which correspond in control ESCs to the naive pluripotent state (d0; very low amounts of Zeb2 mRNA), multipotent progenitors (d4, low Zeb2 mRNA/protein) and early neural progenitors (d6, high Zeb2 mRNA/protein), respectively.

848. HNRNPA2B1 regulates alternative RNA processing in the nervous system and accumulates in granules in ALS IPSC-derived motor neurons [hnRNPA2B1_RNA-seq_mouse_SC]
(Submitter supplied) HnRNPA2B1 encodes an RNA binding protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. However, its function in the nervous system is unclear. Transcriptome-wide cross-linking and immunoprecipitation in mouse spinal cord discover UAGG motifs enriched within ~2,500 hnRNP A2/B1 binding sites and an unexpected role for hnRNP A2/B1 in alternative polyadenylation. Loss of hnRNP A2/B1 results in alternative splicing, including skipping of an exon in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) that reduces D-serine metabolism. more...

(Submitter supplied) Sepsis is a prevalent health issue that can lead to central nervous system (CNS) inflammation with long-term behavioral and cognitive alterations. Using unbiased proteomic profiling of over 100 different cytokines, we found that Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was the most substantially elevated protein in the CNS after peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To determine whether the high level of LCN2 in the CNS is protective or deleterious, we challenged Lcn2-/- mice with peripheral LPS and determined effects on behavior and neuroinflammation. more...

However, modest increases in E2F transcriptional output (E2f7Δ/Δ;E2f8Δ/Δ, E2f1KI/1KI and E2f3bKI/3bKI) resulted in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without additional organ involvement, whereas decreases (E2f1-/- and E2f3b-/-) protected against HCC. more...

(Submitter supplied) MYC genes have both essential roles during normal development and exert oncogenic functions during tumorigenesis. Expression of a dominant-negative allele of MYC, termed OmoMYC, can induce rapid tumor regression in mouse models with little toxicity for normal tissues. How OmoMYC discriminates between physiological and oncogenic functions of MYC is unclear. We have solved the crystal structure of OmoMYC and show that it forms a stable homodimer and as such recognizes DNA in the same manner as the MYC/MAX heterodimer. more...

(Submitter supplied) Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a central component of protein synthesis and cell signaling network. One salient feature of tRNA is its heavily modified status, which can critically impact its function. Here we show that mammalian ALKBH1 is a tRNA demethylase. It mediates the demethylation of N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in tRNAs. The ALKBH1-catalyzed demethylation of the target tRNAs results in their reduced partition in polysomes and their decreased usage in protein synthesis. more...

880. Comparative principles of DNA methylation reprogramming during human and mouse in vitro primordial germ cell specification [Mouse and Human RNA-seq and BS-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Primordial germ cell (PGC) development is characterized by global epigenetic remodeling, which resets genomic potential and establishes an epigenetic ground state. Here we recapitulate PGC specification in vitro from naive embryonic stem cells and characterize the early events of epigenetic reprogramming during the formation of the human and mouse germline. Following rapid de novo DNA methylation during priming to epiblast-like cells, methylation is globally erased in PGC-like cells (PGCLCs). more...

882. Histone H2A T120 phophorylation promotes oncogenic transformation via upregulation of cyclin D1 [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) It is well known that deregulation of chromatin modifiers, such as histone acetylases and methylases, causes malignancies. However, the possible role of histone phosphorylation in carcinogenesis has not yet been elucidated. Here, we found that histone phosphorylation by itself can be the causal event in carcinogenesis. First, we found that histone H2A T120 is phosphorylated in human cancer cell lines and proved that this phosphorylation is catalyzed by hVRK1. more...

887. Pathogenicity of genomic duplications is determined by formation of novel chromatin domains (neo-TADs) (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Genome-scale methods have identified subchromosomal structures so-called topologically associated domains (TADs) that subdivide the genome into discrete regulatory units, establish with their target genes. By re-engineering human duplications at the SOX9 locus in mice combined with 4C-seq and Capture Hi-C experiments, we show that genomic duplications can result in the formation of novel chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology.

To help define the mechanism by which E2F-2 regulates these processes, we performed RNA-sequencing on undifferentiated hematopoietic cells and sorted, orthochromatic erythroblasts obtained from wildtype and E2F-2 knockout animals. In undifferentiated progenitor cells we find a limited number of differentially expressed genes associated with E2F-2-loss, likely due to compensation by other E2F family members. more...

While the colon lacks Paneth cells, Deep Crypt Secretory (DCS) cells are intermingled with Lgr5+ stem cells at crypt bottoms. Here, we report Reg4 as a marker of DCS cells. To investigate a niche function, we eliminated DCS cells using the diphtheria-toxin receptor gene knocked into the murine Reg4 locus. more...

(Submitter supplied) Publication Title: DNA methylation alters transcriptional rates of differentially expressed genes and contributes to pathophysiology in mice fed a high fat diet. It is now well established that an intrauterine environment altered by overnutrition or malnutrition can change gene expression patterns through epigenetic mechanisms that may persist through generations.  However, it is less clear if overnutrition alters epigenetic control of gene expression in adults, or if whether such mechanisms contribute to the pathology of obesity. more...

Of these non-coding transcripts, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the largest and most diverse class, comprising almost 16,000 currently annotated transcripts in human and 10,000 in mouse. Here, we investigated the role of lncRNAs in mammary tumors by performing RNA-Seq on tumor sections and organoids derived from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Neu-NDL mice. more...

Here, we report the identification of a transcription factor—RHOX10—that promotes the initial establishment of SSCs. We were led to this discovery because we found that conditional loss of a large X-linked gene cluster comprised of 33 related homeobox genes, including Rhox10, causes defects predicted if SSCs fail to be generated or maintained. more...

Although a high number of genes were differentially expressed during aging of N mice, only a small fraction of these changed with aging in df/df mice. These alterations involved more than 500 categorized biological processes. The majority of these biological processes, including inflammatory/immune responses, were up-regulated with aging in N mice, while old df/df mice were characterized by down-regulation of these same processes in comparison to age matched N mice. more...

MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of Mef2c in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. more...

955. IRF8 transcription factor controls survival and function of terminally differentiated conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells respectively
(Submitter supplied) Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) has been proposed to be essential for development of monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) and remains highly expressed in differentiated DCs. Transcription factors that are required to maintain the identity of terminally differentiated cells are designated “terminal selectors”. Using BM chimeras, conditional Irf8fl/fl mice and various promotors to target Cre recombinase to different stages of monocyte and DC development, we have identified IRF8 as a terminal selector of the cDC1 lineage controlling survival. more...

956. Sirtuin 1 Promotes Naïve Pluripotency by Deacetylation of Oct4 (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) The enhancer landscape is dramatically restructured as naïve preimplantation epiblasts transition to the post-implantation state of primed pluripotency. A key factor in this process is Otx2, which is upregulated during the early stages of this transition and ultimately recruits Oct4 to a different set of enhancers. In this study we discover that the acetylation status of Oct4 regulates the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. more...

Adoptive transfer experiments in a chronic viral infection model evidenced the rapid and profound decimation of B cells that responded to virus or to concomitantly administered protein. Decimation affected naïve and memory B cells and resulted from biased differentiation into short-lived antibody-secreting cells. more...

982. Chd8 mediates cortical neurogenesis through transcriptional regulation of cell cycle and Wnt signaling genes  
(Submitter supplied) De novo mutations in CHD8 are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we report that Chd8 knockdown during cortical development results in defective neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation that ultimately manifests in abnormal neuronal morphology and behaviors in adult mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that on the one hand Chd8 stimulates the transcription of cell cycle genes, while on the other it precludes the induction of neural specific genes by regulating the expression of PRC2 complex components. more...

However, regulatory mechanisms are still poorly understood despite recent progress in mapping the dynamics in RNA transcripts and DNA methylation1-9. Previous studies suggest that dynamic histone modifications may play important roles in MZT10-12, however direct measurements of chromatin states has been hindered by technical difficulties in profiling histone modifications from small quantities of cells. more...

996. N-Myc induces an EZH2-mediated transcriptional program driving Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer
(Submitter supplied) The transition from castration resistant prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is emerging as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. NEPC are associated with over-expression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). N-Myc is a bona fide driver oncogene in several rare tumor types, but its role in prostate cancer progression is not well established.  Integrating a novel genetically engineered mouse model and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we show that N-Myc over-expression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC tumors which includes an abrogation of AR signaling and induction of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 signaling and that N-Myc interacts with AR and this interaction depends on Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2. more...

We have previously demonstrated that a chromatin-associated protein, AKAP95 (AKAP8), has a remarkable activity in enhancing chromatin transcription. In this study, we have shown that AKAP95 physically interacts with many factors involved in transcription and RNA processing, and functionally regulates pre-mRNA splicing. more...

The role of H3K4 methylation activity of these complexes, however, remains elusive in fate determination of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs and HPCs). Here we address this question by generating a conditional knockout mouse for Dpy30, which is a common core subunit of all Set1/Mll complexes and facilitates genome-wide H3K4 methylation in cells. more...

1015. Genome-wide landscape and functional necessity of heart enhancers
(Submitter supplied) Analysis of the transcriptional changes in the heart resulting from the loss of cardiac enhancers. As there remains a limited understanding of the phenotypic consequences of enhancer mutations, we examined the impact of loss of function mutations by deleting two enhancers near heart disease genes in mice.  In both cases, we observed loss of target gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with heart disease in humans, highlighting the functional importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.

1051. Nascent transript profiling upon in mouse embryonic stem cells under control conditions or Phf5a knockdown
(Submitter supplied) Phf5a regulates transcription elongation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), through regulation of the Paf1 complex. In this study we assayed nascent RNA profiling using global run-on sequncing in mouse ESCs under conditions of self-renewal, differentiation and Phf5a knockdown. These results revealed that genes positively regulated by Paf1 in ESCs exibit RNA elongation pausing on their promoters. We used conditions of self-renewal, differentiation, Phf5a knockdown and Paf1 knockdown to monitor nascent transcript expression changes during Phf5a depletion using global run-on RNA sequencing (GRO-seq). These results revealed that Phf5a through the control of Paf1 complex regulates pause release and elongation of pluripoency-associated genes in embryonic stem cells.

1055. Transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by LSD1 during brown adipocyte differentiation [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) By screening a collection of epigenetic compounds, we find that Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors repress brown adipocyte differentiation. RNAi-mediated Lsd1 knockdown shows similar effect, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, LSD1. Furthermore, adenoviral Cre-mediated LSD1 deletion in mice leads to inhibition of brown adipogenesis, validating the pivotal role of LSD1 in brown fat development in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) Regulatory T (Treg) cells, expressing abundant amounts of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), are reliant on IL-2 produced by activated T cells. This feature implied a key role for a simple network based on IL-2 consumption by Treg cells in their suppressor function. However, congenital deficiency in IL-2R results in reduced expression of the Treg lineage specification factor Foxp3, confounding experimental efforts to understand the role of IL-2R expression and signaling in Treg suppressor function. more...

(Submitter supplied) We explore the heterogeneity of mouse thoracic ganglia demonstrating the presence of an unexpected variety of cell-types and identify specialized populations of nipple- and pilo-erector muscle neurons. These neurons extend axonal projections and are born amongst other neurons during embryogenesis, but remain unspecialized until target organogenesis occurs postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type specification is coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant ligands by the nascent erector muscles.

(Submitter supplied) We have discovered a small subpopulation of virus-specific CD8 T-cells that sustains the T-cell response in chronic infections.  These cells are defined by - and depend on - the expression of the transcription factor Tcf1 (T cell  factor 1) and show key characteristics of central memory cells while lacking an effector signature.  Unlike conventional memory cells, Tcf1+ T-cells display hallmarks of an “exhausted” phenotype,  including the expression of certain inhibitory receptors.

(Submitter supplied) X chromosome inactivation (XCI) compensates for differences in X-chromosome number between male and female mammals. XCI is orchestrated by Xist RNA, whose expression in early development leads to transcriptional silencing of one X-chromosome in the female. Knockout studies have established a requirement for Xist, with inviability of female embryos that inherit an Xist deletion from the father. Here, we report that female mice lacking Xist RNA can, surprisingly, develop and survive to term. more...

1117. Lack of adrenomedullin in mouse endothelial cells results in defective angiogenesis, enhanced vascular permeability, less metastasis, and more brain damage
(Submitter supplied) Adrenomedullin (AM) is a vasodilating peptide involved in the regulation of circulatory homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of certain cardiovascular diseases. AM plays critical roles in blood vessels, including regulation of vascular stability and permeability. To elucidate the autocrine / paracrine function of AM in endothelial cells in vivo. A conditional knockout of AM in endothelial cells (AM EC-KO) was used. more...

1118. Ionic immune suppression within the tumour microenvironment limits T cell effector function
(Submitter supplied) Tumours progress despite being infiltrated by effector T cells. Tumour necrosis is associated with poor survival in a variety of cancers. Here, we report that that necrosis causes release of an intracellular ion, potassium, into the extracellular fluid of human and mouse tumours. Surprisingly, elevated extracellular potassium ([K+]e) was sufficient to profoundly suppress mouse and human T cell anti-tumour function. more...

1120. Temperature regulates splicing efficiency of the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein gene Cirbp
(Submitter supplied) In mammals body temperature fluctuates diurnally around a mean value of 36-37°C. Despite the small differences between minimal and maximal values, body temperature rhythms can drive robust cycles in gene expression in cultured cells and, likely, in, animals. Here we studied the mechanisms responsible for the temperature-dependent expression of Cold- Inducible RNA-Binding Protein (CIRBP). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts exposed to simulated mouse body temperature cycles Cirbp mRNA oscillates about 3-fold in abundance, as it does in mouse liver. more...

1121. Identification of a colitogenic memory CD4+ T cell population that mediates gastrointestinal GVHD
(Submitter supplied) Using an experimental model of graft versus host disease (GVHD) to examine T cell-mediated inflammation within the colon, we identified a unique CD4+ T cell population that constitutively expresses the β2 integrin, CD11c, has a biased central memory phenotype and memory T cell transcriptional profile, possesses innate-like properties by gene expression analysis, and has increased expression of the gut-homing molecules, α4β7 and CCR9.  Using a number of complementary GVHD mouse models, we show that adoptive transfer of these cells results in TH1-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production, augmented pathological damage in the colon, and increased mortality due to early accumulation of these cells in the GI tract.  The pathogenic effects of this CD4+ T cell population was critically dependent upon co-expression of the IL-23 receptor which was required for maximal inflammatory effects.  Colonic inflammation was regulated by IL-10 that was produced by non-Foxp3-expressing CD4+ T cells which attenuated lethality in the absence of functional CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells.  Thus, coordinate expression of CD11c and the IL-23R defines a novel IL-10 regulated, colitogenic memory CD4+ T cell subset that is poised to initiate inflammation when there is loss of tolerance and breakdown of mucosal barriers as occurs in GVHD as well as other immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disorders.

1149. STAT5 is a key transcription factor IL-3-mediated inhibition of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Among the diverse cytokines involved in osteoclast differentiation, IL-3 has been shown to inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-3 activation of STAT5 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through the induction of Id genes. Methods: To investigate the effect of STAT5 on osteoclast differentiation and IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from STAT5 wild-type (Stat5fl/fl) or STAT5 cKO (STAT5;MX1-Cre) were differentiated to osteoclast in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL with or without IL-3; and bone marrow derived macrophges from STAT5 wild-type and STAT5 cKO were overexpressed with PMX-FIG (control) or STAT5A1*6 (constitutively active form of STAT5A) and differentiated to osteoclast. more...

1150. Myocardin-related Transcription Factors Are Required for Skeletal Muscle Development
(Submitter supplied) Myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) play a central role in the regulation of actin expression and cytoskeletal dynamics. Stimuli that promote actin polymerization allow for shuttling of MRTFs to the nucleus where they activate serum response factor (SRF), a regulator of actin and other cytoskeletal protein genes.  SRF is an essential regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation and numerous components of the muscle sarcomere, but the potential involvement of MRTFs in skeletal muscle development has not been examined. more...

1194. Deletion of DXZ4 on the human inactive X chromosome eliminates superdomains and impairs gene silencing
(Submitter supplied) During interphase, the inactive X chromosome (Xi) adopts an unusual 3D configuration known as the Barr body and is largely transcriptionally silent. Despite the importance of X inactivation, little is known about the 3D configuration of Xi and its relationship to gene silencing. We recently showed that in humans, Xi exhibits two distinctive structural features. First, Xi is partitioned into two huge intervals, called superdomains, such that pairs of loci in each superdomain show an enhanced contact frequency with one another. more...

1195. Structural organization of the inactive X chromosome
(Submitter supplied) X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) entails a massive structural reorganization of the inactive X (Xi). However the molecular architecture of the Xi is unknown. Here we show that the Xi lacks typical autosomal features such as active/inactive compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs), except around a small number of genes that escape XCI and remain expressed. Escaping genes form TADs and retain DNA accessibility at promoter-proximal and CTCF binding sites, indicating that these loci can avoid Xist-mediated erasure of chromosomal structure. more...

1215. Mismatch between mtDNA and nuclear DNA determines metabolism and healthy aging
(Submitter supplied) We postulate here that the two singular characteristics of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system—the integration of three potentially antagonistic functions in the same structure and the double genetic origin of the components that assemble together in these molecular machines—make the evolution of an optimal system impossible. As a consequence the system is intrinsically mismatched and has to be continuously monitored, Adjusted and regulated in order to achieve the necessary and variable performance. more...

1219. Genetic Diversity Through RNA Editing: Apobec1-mediated RNA editing in bulk and single cell macrophages and dendritic cells
(Submitter supplied) RNA editing is a mutational mechanism that specifically alters the nucleotide content in sets of transcripts while leaving their cognate genomic blueprint intact. Editing has been detected from bulk RNA-seq data in thousands of distinct transcripts, but apparent editing rates can vary widely (from under 1% to almost 100%). These observed editing rates could result from approximately equal rates of editing within each individual cell in the bulk sample, or alternatively, editing estimates from a population of cells could reflect an average of distinct, biologically significant editing signatures that vary substantially between individual cells in the population. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mutations in PROP1 are the most common cause of hypopituitarism in humans; therefore, unraveling its mechanism of action is highly relevant from a therapeutic perspective. Our current understanding of the role of PROP1 in the pituitary gland is limited to the regulation of pituitary transcription factors Hesx1 and Pit1.  To elucidate the comprehensive PROP1-dependent gene regulatory network, we conducted genome wide analysis of PROP1 DNA binding and effects on gene expression in mutant tissues, isolated stem cells and engineered cell lines. more...

1223. Epigenetic Plasticity Drives Adipogenic and Osteogenic Differentiation of Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Terminal differentiation of multipotent stem cells is achieved through a coordinated cascade of activated transcription factors and epigenetic modifications that drive gene transcription responsible for unique cell fate.  Within the mesenchymal lineage, factors such as RUNX2 and PPARγ are indispensable for osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively.  We therefore investigated genomic binding of transcription factors and accompanying epigenetic modifications that occur during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). more...

1227. Intergenerational consequences of gene-environment induced epigenetic dynamics at rDNA in the mouse (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The ability of environmental exposures in one generation to elicit phenotypic outcomes in subsequent generations suggests that DNA is not the sole vehicle of biological heredity. Such non-genetic inheritance has been demonstrated in a variety of non-mammalian species but, to date, has remained controversial and inadequately characterised in mammals. Here, we show that early life protein restriction (PR) in mice alters DNA methylation at specific genetic variants of multi-copy ribosomal DNA (rDNA), to produce a linear correlation with the extent of growth restriction induced by PR. more...

(Submitter supplied) Vertebrate appendage patterning is programmed by Hox-TALE factors-bound regulatory elements. However, it remains enigmatic which cell lineages are commissioned by Hox-TALE factors to generate regional specific pattern and whether other Hox-TALE co-factors exist. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional mechanisms controlled by the Shox2 transcriptional regulator in limb patterning. Harnessing an osteogenic lineage-specific Shox2 inactivation approach we show that despite widespread Shox2 expression in multiple cell lineages, lack of the stylopod observed upon Shox2 deficiency is a specific result of Shox2 loss of function in the osteogenic lineage. more...

(Submitter supplied) Obesity is linked to the development of metabolic disorders. Expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) from hypertrophy of pre-existing adipocytes and/or differentiation of precursors into new mature adipocytes contributes to obesity. We found that Nck2 expression is largely restricted to WAT, raising the hypothesis that it may play a unique function in that tissue. Using mice lacking Nck2, we found that Nck2 regulates adipocyte hypertrophy thus contributing to increased adiposity and progressive glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. more...

1253. Gene expression analysis to identify Runx1 target genes in GMP, MEP and   Gene expression signature of Runx1Δ/Δ lin- sca- kit+ CD105- CD16/32+ CD150+ (XMP) progenitors
(Submitter supplied) We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. more...

1254. Type 1 interferons induce changes in core metabolism that are critical for immune function
(Submitter supplied) Type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce complex responses that can be beneficial or deleterious, depending on context.  Greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of these cytokines could allow new therapeutic approaches.  We found that type 1 IFNs induced changes in cellular metabolism that were critical for changes in target cell function. This was apparent in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are specialized for type 1 IFN production, where toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9)-dependent activation was found to be dependent on increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) induced by autocrine signaling through the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR). more...

Using an AML mouse model driven by tet-regulated MLL-AF9 co-expressed with oncogenic NRASG12D (Tet-off MLL-AF9), we demonstrated that MLL-AF9 regulates the E protein pathway by suppressing Id2, while activating the expression of its target E2-2. Moreover, we found that Id2 over-expression in Tet-Off MLL-AF9 AML cells in vitro partially phenocopies MLL-AF9 depletion and results inhibition of leukemia growth, loss of leukemia stem cell-associated gene expression pattern and induction of differentiation. more...

1281. Meis1 induces and Prep1 suppresses tumors by exploiting low affinity AP1 binding sites.
(Submitter supplied) We have defined the tumor and tumor suppressor signature for Meis1 and Prep1 (pKnox1), respectively, using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in a cell system in which tumor suppressor Prep1 and oncogene Meis1 compete for tumorigenesis [GSE54221; GSE58802]. In this paper we report that the number of Meis1 or Prep1 DNA binding sites increases linearly with the level of expression of the two transcription factors. Overexpression of Meis1 induces tumors. At the molecular level it modifies the DNA target specificity by increasing the number of low-affinity binding sites, which results in a different choice of consensus sequences with predominance of sites normally bound by the AP1 transcription factor family. Upon concomitant overexpression of Prep1 and Meis1 tumorigenesis is inhibited. Prep1 dominates over Meis1 not only because it partially decreases Meis1 protein level but also because it prevents the binding to a substantial fraction of the low affinity binding sites. Overall, overexpression of Prep1 reverses the nature of the bound and regulated genes from stimulatory to inhibitory of signal transduction and transcription, which suppresses tumorigenesis. By identifying the Meis1 tumor signature, specific relevant signaling pathways are identified. In line with these results, tumorigenic Meis1-overexpressing cells are uniquely hypersensitive to inhibitors of the MAPK/Akt pathways.

1283. Single-cell RNA-seq of sorted and micro-dissected mouse bone marrow cells
(Submitter supplied) We here systematically studied the interaction network of bone marrow cells. To this end, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs, to infer cell identity. After grouping the cells into cell types (based on the single-cell transcriptomes), we identified actual physical interactions that occurred more, or less, than what would be expected by chance. more...

(Submitter supplied) Paneth cells (PCs) are long-lived secretory cells that reside at the bottoms of small intestinal crypts. Besides serving as niche cells for the neighboring Lgr5-positive stem cells, PCs secrete granules containing a broad spectrum of antimicrobial proteins, including lysozymes and defensins1. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore PC differentiation. We found a maturation gradient from early secretory progenitors to mature PCs, capturing the full maturation path of PCs. more...

1301. Recruitment of Rod Photoreceptors from Short Wavelength Sensitive Cones during the Evolution of Nocturnal Vision in Mammals
(Submitter supplied) Vertebrate ancestors had only cone-like photoreceptors. The duplex retina evolved in jawless vertebrates with the advent of highly photosensitive rod-like photoreceptors. Despite cones being the arbiters of high-resolution color vision, rods emerged as the dominant photoreceptor in mammals during a nocturnal phase early in their evolution. We investigated the evolutionary and developmental origins of rods in two divergent vertebrate retinae. more...

Although the components of autophagy in the cytoplasm have been well-studied, molecular basis for the epigenetic regulation of autophagy is poorly understood. Here, we identify histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 as a critical component of autophagy.  We found that nutrient starvation increased CARM1 protein level and subsequently histone H3R17 dimethylation. more...

We developed an axon-TRAP-RiboTag approach in mouse that allows deep-sequencing analysis of ribosome-bound mRNAs in the retinal ganglion cell axons of the developing and adult retinotectal projection in vivo. The embryonic-to-postnatal axonal translatome comprises an evolving subset of enriched genes with axon-specific roles suggesting distinct steps in axon wiring, such as elongation, pruning and synaptogenesis. more...

1315. Gene expression changes in dorsal dermal fibroblasts after beta-catenin deletion in vivo
(Submitter supplied) Goal of this study was to examine gene expression changes upon conditional deletion of beta-catenin at E10.5 in dermal fibroblasts. Method:  Skin tissues were treated in 0/25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 degrees C to obtain single cells for FACS sorting and collected in RNA later. RNA was extracted with Karcturus pico pure kit. The RT and amplification was done using Nugen's ovation RNA-seq system V2.  Libraries for sequencing were prepared with Illumina TruSeq kit. Transcriptome of  FACS sorted E13.5 Engrailed1; RRYFP lineage-marked dorsal dermal fibroblasts was generated next-gen sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq machine. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed by TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays Results: We mapped about 33-49 million sequence reads per sample and obtained 76-79% of uniquely mapped percentage.  We assembled the reads to the mouse ref genome (build mm10).

1316. Stem cell function and sensitivity to genotoxic stress is controlled by protein translation rates
(Submitter supplied) Whether protein synthesis and cellular stress response pathways interact to control stem cell functions is currently unknown. Here, we show that skin stem cells synthesise less protein than their immediate progenitors in vivo, even when forced to proliferate in a tumour model. Our analyses reveal that activation of stress response pathways drives both a global reduction of protein synthesis and altered translation of specific mRNAs that together promote stem cell functions and tumourigenesis. more...

This study establishes the essential role of the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylase KDM6A (UTX) in a balanced basal and luminal cell compartment. Disproportionate formation of basal cells in the absence of KDM6A resulted in disorganized mammary ducts and alveoli and lactation failure. more...

1351. ZFP57 maintains the parent-of-origin-specific expression of the imprinted genes and differentially affects non-imprinted targets in mouse embryonic stem cells 
(Submitter supplied) ZFP57 is necessary for maintaining repressive epigenetic modifications at Imprinting control regions (ICRs). In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), ZFP57 binds ICRs (ICRBS) and many other loci (non-ICRBS). To address the role of ZFP57 on all its target sites, we performed high-throughput and multi-locus analyses of inbred and hybrid mouse ESC lines carrying different gene knockouts. By using an allele-specific RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate that ZFP57 loss results in derepression of the imprinted allele of multiple genes in the imprinted clusters. more...

1353. De novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B are essential of global DNA methylation maintenance [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation is the net result of deposition by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, 3A and 3B) and removal by the Ten-Eleven Translocation 1-3 (TET1-3) family of proteins and/or passive loss by replication. The relative contribution of the individual enzymes and pathways is only partially understood. Here we comprehensively analyzed and mathematically simulated the dynamics of DNA de-methylation during the reprogramming of the hypermethylated serum-cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to the hypomethylated 2i-cultured ground state of mESC. more...

1355. Establishing Chromatin Regulatory Landscape during Mouse Preimplantation Development
(Submitter supplied) Upon fertilization, parental chromatin undergoes extensive reprogramming to generate the highly dynamic chromatin of the inner cell mass (ICM) cells from which an organism is derived. How the chromatin regulatory landscape is established during this process has remained a mystery due to the technical difficulties in chromatin analysis using limited cell numbers. Using a low-input DNase I sequencing (liDNase-seq) method, we generated DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) maps of mouse preimplantation embryos. more...

(Submitter supplied) Global demethylation is part of a conserved program of epigenetic reprogramming to naïve pluripotency. The transition from primed hypermethylated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to naïve hypomethylated ones (serum-to-2i) is a valuable model system for epigenetic reprogramming. We present a mathematical model, which accurately predicts global DNA demethylation kinetics. Experimentally we show that the main drivers of global demethylation are neither active mechanisms (Aicda, Tdg, Tet1-3) nor the reduction of de novo methylation. more...

(Submitter supplied) NANOG is a key pluripotency factor in embryonic stem cells that is frequently expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, a direct link between NANOG and SCCs remains to be established. Here, we show that inducible overexpression of NANOG in mouse skin epithelia dramatically promotes the formation of carcinomas upon chemical carcinogenesis. Gene expression analyses in pre-malignant skin indicate that NANOG induces a large set of genes associated to stemness and to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

1384. The RNA-binding protein TTP is a global post-transcriptional regulator of feedback control in inflammation [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) facilitate post-transcriptional control of eukaryotic gene expression at multiple levels. The RBP tristetraprolin (TTP/Zfp36) is a signal-induced phosphorylated anti-inflammatory protein guiding unstable mRNAs of pro-inflammatory proteins for degradation and preventing translation. Using iCLIP, we have identified numerous mRNA targets bound by wild-type TTP and by a non-MK2-phosphorylatable TTP mutant (TTP-AA) in 1h LPS-stimulated macrophages and correlated their interaction with TTP to changes at the level of mRNA abundance and translation in a transcriptome-wide manner. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mediator is regarded a general co-activator of RNA-Polymerase II dependent transcription but not much is known about its function and regulation in mouse pluripotent embryonic stem cells (mESC). One means of controlling Mediator  function is provided by binding of the Cdk8 module (Med12, Cdk8, Ccnc and Med13) to Mediator. Here we report that the Cdk8 module subunit Med12 operates together with PRC1 to silence developmental key genes in the pluripotent state. more...

1399. Identification of CAMTA1 target genes in the adult mouse hippocampus
(Submitter supplied) The formation of long-term memory requires signaling from the synapse to the nucleus to mediate neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription. Synapse-to-nucleus communication is initiated by influx of calcium ions through synaptic NMDA receptors and/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and involves the activation of transcription factors by calcium/calmodulin signaling in the nucleus. Recent studies have drawn attention to a new family of transcriptional regulators, the so-called calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) proteins. more...

(Submitter supplied) Precise control of mRNA decay is fundamental for robust yet not exaggerated inflammatory responses to pathogens. Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP, a major inflammation-limiting factor, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. more...

1421. Single Cell Sequencing Identifies Key Epigenetic Regulators in Nuclear Transfer Mediated Reprogramming [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Differentiated cell can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. more...

1438. Injury-induced enhancer remodelling in spinal microglia - a novel mechanism for pain chronification? [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Chronic pain is common and devastating. Yet, its precise molecular origins remain unclear. The condition induces well-characterised changes in neurons and microglia, but it is unknown why they persist long after the precipitating injury has healed. We posit a role for enhancers - regions of open chromatin that define a cell’s transcription factor binding profile. Enhancer profiles can alter upon environmental stimulation, functioning as a kind of molecular memory. more...

1440. Functional characterization of RNA-binding protein IMP2 in primary Glioma cell lines [HTS]
(Submitter supplied) Cancer stem cells (CSC) dictate tumor cell heterogeneity in diverse cancer types and arise, in part, from microRNA (miRNA)-dependent alteration of gene expression. The let-7 miRNA family induces differentiation by silencing genes that maintain stemness and is repressed by the RNA-binding proteins LIN28A/B, which preserve stemness in normal embryonic and malignant cells. Here, we observed that LIN28A/B is undetectable in glioma stem cells (GSC) whereas let-7 and, paradoxically, their target genes are highly expressed. more...

The cytokine IL-10 maintains the macrophage anti-inflammatory response such that loss of IL-10 results in chronic intestinal inflammation. To investigate how IL-10-deficiency alters IM programming and bacterial tolerance, we studied changes in chromatin accessibility in response to bacteria in macrophages from two distinct niches, the intestine and bone-marrow, from both wild-type and IL-10-deficient (Il10-/- ) mice. more...

1453. Cross-species comparison of epigenetic poising in the mammalian germ line
(Submitter supplied) In the mouse, germ cells and embryonic stem cells maintain an epigenetically poised (bivalent) state, defined by the simultaneous presence of the opposing histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and by transcriptional repression, at the promoters of many developmental regulatory genes. We compared genome-wide chromatin state in male germ cells of five mammalian and one avian species. We identified a set of 405 genes whose promoters retain poised chromatin in the mammalian germ line throughout mammalian evolution.

1458. The interaction of PRC2 with RNA or chromatin is mutually antagonistic
(Submitter supplied) Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) modifies chromatin to maintain genes in a repressed state during development. PRC2 is primarily associated with CpG islands at repressed genes and also possesses RNA binding activity. However, the RNAs that bind PRC2 in cells, the subunits that mediate these interactions, and the role of RNA in PRC2 recruitment to chromatin all remain unclear. By performing iCLIP for PRC2 in comparison with other RNA binding proteins, we show here that PRC2 binds nascent RNA at essentially all active genes. more...

1473. Vascular smooth muscle cell contractile protein expression is increased through protein kinase G-dependent and –independent pathways by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibition and deficiency
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Homeostatic control of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation is critical for contractile activity and regulation of blood flow. Recently, we reported that pre-contracted blood vessels are relaxed and the phenotype of VSMC is regulated from a synthetic to contractile state by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) inhibition. In the current study, we investigated whether the increase in the expression of VSMC contractile proteins by inhibition and knockdown of G6PD is mediated through a protein kinase G (PKG)-dependent pathway and whether it regulates blood pressure Methods: Coronary arteries (LAD) isolated from bovine heart mRNA profiles of 12-16 week old wild type (WT) and G6PD-deficient mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500. more...

Whether the epigenetic signatures that are crucial for brain development and function and that are sensitive to in vitro culture are similar between native brain tissues and their artificial counterpart generated from ESC is largely unknown.  Here, using RNA-seq we have compared the parental origin-dependent expression of imprinted genes (IGs), a model of epigenetic regulation, in cerebral cortex generated either in vivo, or from ESCs using in vitro corticogenesis, a model that reproduces the landmarks of in vivo corticogenesis. more...

Here, we show that selective deletion of CREB in T cells or Th17 cells impaired Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo, and led to resistance to autoimmune diseases. Mechanistically, CREB, activated by CD3-PKC-ϴ signaling, plays a key role in regulating Th17 differentiation, at least in part through directly binding to the Il17-Il17f gene locus. more...

1532. Myc-dependent gene activation and repression in oncogene-addicted liver tumors (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Tumors driven by activation of the transcription factor Myc generally show oncogene addiction. However, the gene-expression programs that depend upon sustained Myc activity in those tumors remain unknown. We have addressed this issue in a model of liver carcinoma driven by a reversible tet-Myc transgene, combining gene expression profiling with the mapping of Myc and RNA Polymerase II on chromatin. Switching off the oncogene in advanced carcinomas revealed that Myc is required for the continuous activation and repression of distinct sets of genes, constituting no more than half of those deregulated during tumor progression, and an even smaller subset of all Myc-bound genes. We further showed that a Myc mutant unable to associate with the co-repressor protein Miz1 is defective in the initiation of liver tumorigenesis. Altogether, our data provide the first detailed analysis of a Myc-dependent transcriptional program in a fully developed carcinoma, revealing that the critical effectors of Myc in tumor maintenance must be included within defined subsets (ca. 1,300 each) of activated and repressed genes.

1553. Functional characterization of DNA methylation in the oligodendrocyte lineage [RNASeq_Dnmt1cKO_OPC]
(Submitter supplied) Oligodendrocytes derive from progenitors (OPC) through the interplay of epigenetic and transcriptional events. By integrating high-resolution methylomics, RNA-sequencing and multiple transgenic lines, this study defines the role of DNMT1 in developmental myelination. We detected hypermethylation of genes related to cell cycle and neurogenesis during differentiation of OPC, and yet, genetic ablation of Dnmt1 resulted in inefficient OPC expansion and severe hypomyelination associated with ataxia and tremors in mice. more...

1560. A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. more...

(Submitter supplied) Genetic ablation of the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 induces widespread demethylation and transcriptional activation of CpG-rich IAP (intracisternal A particle) proviruses. Here, we report that this phenomenon is not simply a consequence of loss of DNA methylation. By exploiting conditional deletions of Dnmt1 and Np95, each of which is essential for maintenance methylation, we find that while IAPs are indeed de-repressed in Dnmt1-ablated embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), these proviruses remain silenced in Np95-ablated cells, despite similar kinetics of passive demethylation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Many studies have demonstrated that somatic cell differentiation during development is accompanied by extensive demethylation of specific sites relevant to each cell type.  Although the mechanism of this process has not yet been elucidated, it is likely to involve the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC by Tet enzymes [Ziller, 2013 #5787].  In this paper, we show that a Tet2/Tet3 conditional knockout at early stages of B-cell development largely prevents lineage-specific programmed demethylation events. more...

1589. Distinct myeloid progenitor differentiation pathways uncovered through single cell RNA sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question.    We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a seperation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

(Submitter supplied) The purpose of current study is to identify the differentiated gene expression associated with mouse 11B3 deletion, syntenic to human chromosome 17p13.1. We compared four different mouse acute myeloid leukemia cells, freshly isolated from mouse bone marrows with either 11B3fl/p53fl;shNf1;shMll3;Vav1-Cre or p53fl/fl;shNf1;shMll3;Vav1-Cre. The RNA-seq results indicate that genes located on chromosome 11B3 mostly reduce gene expression level in 11B3 deleted leukemia cells.

On RAG1-deficient background, we found that monoclonal FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells developed in the thymus in the absence of other T cells. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that the thymic niche is not a limiting factor in nTreg development. more...

Here, we sought to prospectively identify chemicals that share transcriptomic signatures with neurological disorders by exposing mouse cortical neuron-enriched cultures to hundreds of chemicals commonly found in the environment and on food.  We find that rotenone, a pesticide associated with Parkinson’s disease risk, and certain fungicides, including pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, famoxadone, and fenamidone, produce transcriptional changes in vitro that are similar to those seen in brain samples from humans with autism, advanced age and neurodegeneration (Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease). more...

(Submitter supplied) Mutations in genes encoding splicing factors (which we refer to as spliceosomal genes) are commonly found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations recurrently affect specific amino acid residues, leading to perturbed normal splice site and exon recognition. Spliceosomal gene mutations are always heterozygous and rarely occur together with one another, suggesting that cells may tolerate only a partial deviation from normal splicing activity. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor STAT5 is fundamental to the mammalian immune system. However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remains controversial. We addressed this longstanding question in primary CD4+ 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that, although both influence regulatory (Treg) and effector T cell responses, and control many of the same genes, they are not functionally equivalent and, in fact, only the latter is required for immunological tolerance. more...

To interrogate the functional requirement for PKM2 during development and tissue homeostasis, we generated germline PKM2 null mice (Pkm2-/-). Unexpectedly, despite being the primary isoform expressed in most wild-type adult tissues, we found that Pkm2-/- mice are viable and fertile. more...

1622. Sequence Features Accurately Predict Genome-wide MeCP2 Binding in vivo
(Submitter supplied) MECP2 is critical for proper brain development and expressed at near-histone levels in neurons, but the mechanism of its genomic localization remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution MeCP2 binding data, we show that genetic features alone can predict binding with 88% accuracy. Integrating MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in a probabilistic graphical model, we demonstrate that previously reported methylation preferences may be due to MeCP2’s affinity to GC-rich chromatin, a result replicated using published data. more...

The 3D transcriptome reveals that (i) the epiblast is partitioned into transcription domains corresponding to regions of epiblast where cells are endowed specifically with ectoderm and mesendoderm potency, (ii) novel lineage markers are identified as genes expressed in epiblast domains populated by cells displaying different lineage fates, (iii) functionally related gene regulatory circuitry and signaling pathways are acting in concert in the transcriptional domains, and (iv) the spatial information provides reference zipcodes for mapping the prospective address of cell samples from different embryos and stem cell lines. more...

Loss of UTX in female mice is embryonic lethal. Unexpectedly, male UTX-null mice escape embryonic lethality due to expression of UTY, a paralog lacking H3K27-demethylase activity. This suggests that UTX plays an enzyme-independent role in development, and challenges the need for active H3K27-demethylation in vivo. more...

The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown.  Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. more...

(Submitter supplied) The most immature progenitors in the murine thymus are early T lineage progenitors (ETP). These cells are the precursors of more mature thymocytes that ultimately leave the thymus and colonize peripheral lymphoid tissues. As part of our efforts to define age-related changes in ETP, we harvested them from mice of different ages and performed whole transcriptome profiling. This analysis revealed major differences in patterns of gene expression between young and old ETP, and we were particularly struck by the significantly reduced expression of the gene encoding high mobility group A 2 protein (Hmga2).

(Submitter supplied) Analysis of whole genome expression changes in livers from wild type animals and animals with a liver specific transgenic over expression of Cyp7a1. Mice were given a chronic, repetitive administration of LPS for 7 days. Our prior analysis had indicated that inflammation suppresses Cyp7a1 and that this leads to accumulation of intermediates in the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. Here, we hypothesized that over expression of Cyp7a1 would not affect the changes in transcriptional state due to chronic administration of LPS. more...

(Submitter supplied) FUS is an RNA-binding protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cytoplasmic FUS-containing aggregates are often associated with concomitant loss of nuclear FUS. Whether loss of nuclear FUS function, gain of a cytoplasmic function, or a combination of both lead to neurodegeneration remains elusive. To address this question, we generated knock-in mice expressing mislocalized cytoplasmic FUS and complete FUS knock-out mice. more...

For this we dissociated tumors and isolated Ecad positive tumor cells by FACS sorting. We confirmed that PyMT tumors contain a small set of tumor cells that have undergone EMT in the primary tumor and that E-cadherin can be used as a marker on single cell level for mesenchymal status in this model.

Using various AAV-shRNA vectors under the high-expressing U6 and low-expressing H1 promoters, we found that dose-limiting toxicity was strongly correlated with an shRNA concentration of  >12% of total microRNA levels.  Toxicity was associated with a specific reduction in the first synthesized 22nt isoform of miR-122-5p, resulting in the specific de-repression of miR-122 target mRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Male gender is protective against multiple sclerosis and other T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. This protection may be due, in part, to higher androgen levels in males. Androgen binds to the androgen receptor (AR) to regulate gene expression, but how androgen protects against autoimmunity is not well-understood. Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) prevents autoimmunity by promoting self-antigen expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells, such that developing T cells that recognize these self-antigens within the thymus undergo clonal deletion. more...

As we found IL-17A is induced immediately after bone injury and Il17a−/− mice showed delayed healing, we analyzed the effects of IL-17A on mesenchymal cells in the repair tissue. Most of the IL-17RA+ cells were PαS cells. We collected these cells and analyzed their response to IL-17A by RNA sequencing. This analysis will provide a mechanistic insight into the mechanism of how IL-17A promote bone formation in the context of bone fracture healing.

(Submitter supplied) Mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) consist of coding sequence (CDS) and 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions, typically expected to show similar abundance within a given neuron. Examining mRNA from defined neurons we unexpectedly show extremely common unbalanced expression of cognate 3’ UTR and CDS sequences, observing many genes with high UTR relative to CDS, and others with high CDS to UTR. By in situ hybridization 19 of 19 genes examined show a broad range of UTR to CDS expression ratios in different neurons and other tissues. more...

1841. Targeted deletion of miR-132/212 impairs memory and alters the hippocampal transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) miR-132 and miR-212 are structurally-related microRNAs that have been found to exert powerful modulatory effects within the central nervous system (CNS). Notably, these microRNAs are tandomly processed from the same non-coding transcript, and share a common seed sequence: thus it has been difficult to assess the distinct contribution of each microRNA to gene expression within the CNS. Here, we employed a combination of conditional knockout and transgenic mouse models to examine the contribution of the miR-132/212 gene locus to learning and memory, and then to assess the distinct effects that each microRNA has on hippocampal gene expression. more...

Differentially regulated genes and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that altered expression of the AA-mediated genes in both GM (growth medium) and DM (differentiation medium) were highly enriched in the signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation and differentiation, however, the genes encoding enzymes in biochemical pathways of ketolysis for energy production were not transcriptionally changed in the cells cultured in either GM or DM in response to AA. more...

1864. 4C-ker: A method to reproducibly identify genome-wide interactions captured by 4C-Seq experiments
(Submitter supplied) 4C-Seq has proven to be a powerful technique to identify genome-wide interactions with a single locus of interest (or "bait") that can be important for gene regulation. However, analysis of 4C-Seq data is complicated by the many biases inherent to the technique. An important consideration when dealing with 4C-Seq data is the differences in resolution of signal across the genome that result from differences in 3D distance separation from the bait. more...

1883. Hdac3 Interaction with p300 Histone Acetyltransferase Regulates the Oligodendrocyte and Astrocyte Lineage Fate Switch (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Establishment and maintenance of CNS glial cell identity ensures proper brain development and function, yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying glial fate control remain poorly understood. Here we show that the histone deacetylase Hdac3 controls oligodendrocyte-specification gene Olig2 expression, and functions as a molecular switch for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte lineage determination. Our data suggest that Hdac3 cooperates with p300 to prime and maintain oligodendrogenic programs while inhibiting Stat3-mediated astrogliogenesis, and thereby regulate phenotypic commitment at the point of oligodendrocyte-astrocytic fate decision.

1911. Sequential Notch activation regulates ventricular chamber development
(Submitter supplied) Ventricular chambers are essential for the rhythmic contraction and relaxation that occurs in every hearbeat throughout life. Congenital abnormalities in ventricular chamber formation cause severe human heart defects. How the early trabecular meshwork of myocardial fibres forms and subsequently develops into mature chambers is still poorly understood. Here we show that Notch signalling first connects chamber endocardium and myocardium to sustain trabeculation and later coordinates ventricular patterning and compaction with coronary vessel development to give rise to the mature chamber via a temporal sequence of ligand signalling determined by the glycosyltransferase Manic Fringe (Mfng). more...

Here we show that ligand activation of LXRs in liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long non-coding RNA LeXis as an unexpected mediator of this effect. more...

(Submitter supplied) The fallopian tube epithelium is one of the potential sources of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). The use of estrogen only hormone replacement therapy increases ovarian cancer risk. Despite estrogen’s influence in OVCA, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) typically demonstrate only a 20% response rate. This low response could be due to a variety of factors including the loss of estrogen receptor signaling or the role of estrogen receptor signaling in different potential cell types of origin. more...

1930. 7SK-BAF axis controls pervasive transcription at enhancers [GRO-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Eukaryotic genomes are extensively transcribed, but unfettered transcription alters gene expression and leads to genome damage by several means. Divergent transcription occurs at active enhancers and promoters, distinct classes of cis-regulatory elements critical for precise control of gene expression. A key step in RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription is promoter-proximal pausing, which occurs bidirectionally ~25-60 nucleotides downstream of transcription start sites (TSS). more...

1931. The helix-loop-helix protein ID2 governs NK cell fate by tuning their sensitivity to interleukin-15
(Submitter supplied) The inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is essential for NK cell development with its canonical role in this pathway being to antagonize E-proteins, silencing E-box gene expression and subsequent commitment to the T and B cell lineages. However, how E-box genes prevent NK cell development and homeostasis remains enigmatic. Here we identify a key role for Id2 in regulating the threshold for IL-15 receptor signaling and homeostasis of NK cells by repressing multiple E-protein target genes including Socs3. more...

1954. An epigenetic switch ensures transposon repression upon acute loss of DNA methylation in ES cells (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation profoundly impacts genome regulation, notably through the control of transposons. DNA methylation is extensively remodeled during two developmental periods in mammals, gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. Most of transposons families become then hypomethylated, raising the question of their regulation in absence of DNA methylation. To induce genome-wide demethylation, we relied on hypomethylation-inducing culture conditions of murine embryonic stem cells. more...

1965. MicroRNAs 24 and 27 suppress allergic inflammation and target a network of regulators of T helper-2 cell-associated cytokine production
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate decisions in immune responses. They act by coordinate repression of multiple target genes, a property that we exploited to uncover regulatory networks that govern T helper-2 (Th2) cells. A functional screen of individual miRNAs in primary T cells uncovered multiple miRNAs that inhibited  Th2 cell differentiation. Among these were miR-24 and miR-27, miRNAs coexpressed from two genomic clusters, which each functioned independently to limit interleukin-4 (IL-4) production. more...

1967. H2A.Z.1 mono-ubiquitylation antagonizes BRD2 to maintain poised chromatin in ESCs [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Histone variant H2A.Z occupies the promoters of active and poised, bivalent genes in ESCs to regulate developmental programs, yet how it contributes to these contrasting states is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the function of H2A.Z.1 mono-ubiquitylation (H2A.Z.1ub) by mutation of the PRC1 target residues (H2A.Z.1K3R3). We show that H2A.Z.1K3R3 is properly incorporated at target promoters in murine ESCs (mESCs), however, loss of mono-ubiquitylation leads to de-repression of bivalent genes, loss of Polycomb binding, and to faulty lineage commitment. more...

However, to what extent immunosurveillance occurs in spontaneous cancers and the composition of participating cell types remain obscure.  Here we show that cell transformation triggers a tissue-resident lymphocyte response in oncogene-induced murine cancer models.  Non-circulating cytotoxic lymphocytes, derived from innate, TCRαβ and TCRγδ lineages, expand in early tumors. more...

1982. A Stringent Systems Approach Uncovers Gene-Specific Mechanisms Regulating Inflammation [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Much has been learned about transcriptional cascades and networks from large-scale systems analyses of high-throughput data sets. However, analysis methods that optimize statistical power through simultaneous evaluation of thousands of ChIP-seq peaks or differentially expressed genes possess substantial limitations in their ability to uncover mechanistic principles of transcriptional control. By examining nascent transcript RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and binding motif data sets from lipid A-stimulated macrophages with increased attention to the quantitative distribution of signals, we identified unexpected relationships between the in vivo binding properties of inducible transcription factors, motif strength, and transcription. more...

1983. Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis (PAGODA)
(Submitter supplied) The extent of transcriptional diversity in mouse NPCs is likely to be influenced by a variety of unexamined factors that include programmed cell death, genomic mosaicism as well as a variety of “environmental” influences such as changes in exposure to signaling lipids. We therefore used scRNA-seq to assess a cohort of cortical NPCs from an embryonic mouse. We demonstrate that PAGODA (Pathway And Geneset OverDispersion Analysis) effectively recovers the known neuroanatomical and functional organization of NPCs, identifying multiple aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity within the developing mouse cortex that are difficult to discern by the existing heterogeneity analysis approaches.

(Submitter supplied) Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against BCR-ABL1, the product of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, have revolutionized treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, acquired resistance to TKIs is a significant clinical problem in CML, and TKI therapy is much less effective against Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). BCR-ABL1, via phosphorylated Tyr177, recruits the adapter GAB2 as part of a GRB2/GAB2 complex. more...

Induction of fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF) is a promising means to treat these disorders; however, precisely how HbF expression is silenced in adult erythroid cells is not fully understood. Here, we show that the LRF/ZBTB7A transcription factor is a potent repressor of HbF production. LRF inactivation derepresses embryonic/fetal _-globin expression in mouse and human adult erythroid cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Most mammalian genes display alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). Previous studies have indicated preferential expression of APA isoforms with short 3’UTRs in testes. Here we show widespread shortening of 3’UTR by APA during the first wave of spermatogenesis in mouse, with 3’UTRs being the shortest in spermatids. Shortening of 3’UTR eliminates destabilizing elements, such as U-rich elements and transposable elements, which appear to be highly potent for transcript elimination during spermatogenesis. more...

2017. Transcriptional effects of I-PpoI induced DNA double strand breaks in mouse lymphocytes
(Submitter supplied) DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair can cause extensive epigenetic changes. As a result, DSBs have been proposed to promote transcriptional and, ultimately, physiological dysfunction via both cell-intrinsic and cell-non-autonomous pathways. Studying the consequences of DSBs in higher organisms has, however, been hindered by a scarcity of tools for controlled DSB induction. Using a mouse model for both tissue-specific and temporally controlled DSB formation, we investigated the transcriptional response to break repair.

2026. RNA seq of pancreatic islets isolated from free fatty acid receptor 3 knockout (Ffar3 KO) and wildtype (Ffar3 WT) male mice
(Submitter supplied) The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor (free fatty acid receptor-3; FFAR3) is expressed in pancreatic beta cells; however, its role in insulin secretion is not clearly defined. Here, we examined the role of FFAR3 in insulin secretion. Using islets from global knockout FFAR3 (Ffar3-/-) mice, we explored the role of FFAR3 and ligand-induced FFAR3 signaling on glucose stimulated insulin secretion. RNA sequencing was also performed to gain greater insight into the impact of FFAR3 deletion on the islet transcriptome. First exploring insulin secretion, it was determined that Ffar3-/- islets secrete more insulin in a glucose-dependent manner as compared to wildtype (WT) islets. Next, exploring its primary endogenous ligand, propionate, and a specific agonist for FFAR3, signaling by FFAR3 inhibited glucose-dependent insulin secretion, which occurred through a Gαi/o pathway. To help understand these results, transcriptome analyses by RNA-sequencing of Ffar3-/- and WT islets observed multiple genes with well known roles in islet biology to be altered by genetic knockout of FFAR3. Our data shows that FFAR3 signaling mediates glucose stimulated insulin secretion through Gαi/o sensitive pathway. Future studies are needed to more rigorously define the role of FFAR3 by in vivo approaches.

2031. Pluripotent Stem Cells Induced from Mouse Neural Stem Cells and Small Intestinal Epithelial Cells by Small Molecule Compounds
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cells can be generated by pure small molecule compounds. However, only fibroblasts, a heterogeneous cell population, were reported for use in chemical reprogramming, and the efficiency is relatively low, raising the possibility that chemically induced pluripotent stem cells (CiPSCs) are derived from a specific cell subpopulation residing in fibroblast culture. Thus, it is of interest to know whether chemical reprogramming can be induced in other cell types, even using the same chemical cocktail. more...

2032. ETO Family Protein Mtgr1 Mediates Prdm14 Functions in Stem Cell Maintenance
(Submitter supplied) Prdm14 is a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and primordial germ cell (PGC) formation. It exerts its function, at least in part, through repressing genes associated with epigenetic modification and cell differentiation. Here, we show that this repressive function is mediated through an ETO-family co-repressor Mtgr1, which tightly binds to the pre-SET/SET domains of Prdm14 and co-occupies its genomic targets in mouse ESCs. more...

Here we investigated whether LPA acts directly on the hippocampal stem cells and whether LPA1 could be a functional marker for their prospective isolation. Our results reveal that exogenous LPA increases precursor potential in vitro and net neurogenesis in vivo, an effect that is mediated by Akt activation. more...

2044. Genetic code expansion in stable cell lines enables encoded chromatin modification
(Submitter supplied) Genetically encoded unnatural amino acids provide powerful strategies for  modulating the molecular functions of proteins in mammalian cells. However this  approach has not been coupled to genome-wide measurements, because efficient  unnatural amino acid incorporation is limited to readily transfectable cells and  leads to very heterogeneous expression. We demonstrate that rapid piggybac  integration of the orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylS)/tRNAPyl  CUA pair  (and its derivatives) into the mammalian genome enables efficient, homogeneous  unnatural amino acid incorporation into target proteins in diverse cells, and we  reveal the distinct transcriptional responses of ES cells and MEFs to amber  suppression. more...

Therefore, identification of chemopreventive agents with anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic activities, is indispensable. Recently, we found that combinations of silibinin (Sil) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) significantly inhibited lung tumorigenesis induced by 4-(methylnitro-samino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and enhanced by chronic treatment with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). more...

2062. EBF2 promotes the recruitment of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue
(Submitter supplied) The induction of beige/brite adipose cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with protection against high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in animals. The helix-loop-helix transcription factor Early B-Cell Factor-2 (EBF2) regulates brown adipose tissue development. We examined the role of EBF2 in beige fat cell biogenesis by comparing transcriptome in wildtype and EBF2-overexpressing mice in the adipose tissue.

2093. NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that couples BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD4 is a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we demonstrate that the AML maintenance function of BRD4 requires its interaction with NSD3, which belongs to a subfamily of H3K36 methyltransferases. Unexpectedly, AML cells were found to only require a short isoform of NSD3 that lacks the methyltransferase domain. We show that NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that sustains leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, by using a PWWP chromatin reader module, and by employing an acidic transactivation domain. more...

(Submitter supplied) We investigated genome-wide nucleosome coverage and histone methylation occupancies in somatic MEFs, intermediate pre-iPSCs and fully reprogrammed iPSCs. We found that nucleosome occupancies increased in promoter regions and decreased in intergenic regions in pre-iPSCs and then recover to an intermediate level in iPSCs. Nucleosomes in pre-iPSCs are much more phased than those in MEFs and iPSCs. Bivalent, active, repressive domains are cell type-specific and change dynamically during reprogramming. more...

2132. Dzip3 regulates developmental genes in mouse embryonic stem cells by reorganizing 3D chromatin conformation [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) In mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells), ubiquitylation of histone H2A lysine 119 represses a large number of developmental genes and maintains mES cell pluripotency. It has been suggested that a number of H2A ubiquitin ligases as well as deubiquitylases and related peptide fragments contribute to a delicate balance between self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation in mES cells. Here, we tested whether known H2A ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases are involved in mES cell regulation and discovered that Dzip3, the E3 ligase of H2AK119, represses differentiation-inducible genes as well as Ring1B. more...

All physiological functions of Lin28A characterized so far have been attributed to its repression of let-7 miRNA biogenesis or modulation of the mRNA translational efficiency. Here we show that Lin28A directly binds to a consensus DNA sequence in vitro and in mouse embryonic stem cells in vivo. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq reveal the enrichment of Lin28A binding around transcription start sites, and a positive correlation between its genomic occupancy and expression of many associated genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Erasure and subsequent re-instatement of DNA methylation in the germline, especially at imprinted CpG islands (CGIs), is crucial to embryogenesis in mammals. The mechanisms underlying DNA methylation establishment remain poorly understood, but a number of post-translational modifications of histones are implicated in antagonizing or recruiting the de novo DNA methylation complex. In mouse oogenesis, DNA methylation establishment occurs on a largely unmethylated genome and in non-dividing cells, making it a highly informative model for examining how histone modifications can shape the DNA methylome. more...

2158. Complementarity and redundancy of IL-22-producing innate lymphoid cells
(Submitter supplied) Homeostasis of the gut microbiota is pivotal to the survival of the host. Intestinal T cells and Innate Lymphoid cells (ILCs) control the composition of the microbiota and respond to its perturbations. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) plays a pivotal role in the immune control of gut commensal and pathogenic bacteria and is secreted by a heterogeneous population of intestinal T cells, NCR- ILC3 and NCR+ILC3. Expression of NCR by ILC3 is believed to define an irreversible effector ILC3 end-state fate in which these cells are key to control of bacterial infection via their production of IL-22. Here we identify the core transcriptional signature that drives the differentiation of NCR- ILC3 into NCR+ ILC3 and reveal that NCR+ILC3 exhibit more plasticity than originally thought, as NCR+ ILC3 can revert to NCR- ILC3. Contrary to the prevailing understanding of NCR+ ILC3 genesis and function, in vivo analyses of mice conditionally deleted of the key ILC3 genes Stat3, Il22, Tbet and Mcl1 demonstrated that NCR+ ILC3 were not essential for the control of colonic infections in the presence of T cells. However, NCR+ ILC3 were mandatory for homeostasis of the caecum. Our data identify that the interplay of intestinal T cells and ILC3 results in robust complementary fail-safe mechanisms that ensure gut homeostasis.

2162. Global genome splicing analysis reveals an increased number of alternatively spliced genes with aging
(Submitter supplied) Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism for the development of different tissues; however, not much is known about changes to alternative splicing during aging. Splicing events may become more frequent and widespread genome-wide as tissues age and the splicing machinery stringency decreases. Using skin, skeletal muscle, bone, thymus and white adipose tissue from wild-type C57BL6/J male mice (4 and 18-months-old), we examined the effect of age on splicing by AS analysis of the differential exon usage of the genome. more...

2196. Population transcriptional profiling of in vitro polarized Th17 cells, either sorted for IL17A/GFP+ or unsorted
(Submitter supplied) Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. more...

2198. Circadian and light-driven regulation of rod dark adaptation
(Submitter supplied) The sensation of light is initiated in photoreceptor cells by the photoisomerization of a chromophore molecule from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Continuous visual perception requires recycling of the spent chromophore back to the 11-cis form through the visual cycle, a series of reactions in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Light-driven chromophore consumption by photoreceptors is greater in daytime compared to night time, suggesting that correspondingly higher activity of the visual cycle may be required. more...

Here we show that H3K9me2 directs repression of 2-cell stage specific genes in nascent embryos to facilitate preimplantation development. Thereafter, genome-wide accumulation of H3K9me2 is crucial for postimplantation development, and coincides with redistribution of EZH2-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). more...

2230. BCL9/9L-β-catenin Signaling is Associated With Poor Outcome in Colorectal Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Canonical Wnt signaling output is mediated by β-catenin, which interacts with LEF/TCF transcription factors and recruits a general transcriptional activation complex to its C-terminus. Its N-terminus binds BCL9/9L proteins, which bind co-activators that in mammals contribute to fine-tuning the transcriptional output. We found that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene expression signature was strongly associated with patient outcome in colorectal cancer and that stem cell and mesenchymal genes determine its prognostic value. more...

2233. SOX9 modulates the expression of key transcription factors required for heart valve development
(Submitter supplied) Heart valve formation initiates when endothelial cells of the heart transform into mesenchyme and populate the cardiac cushions. The transcription factor, SOX9, is highly expressed in the cardiac cushion mesenchyme, and is essential for heart valve development. Loss of Sox9 in mouse cardiac cushion mesenchyme alters cell proliferation, embryonic survival, and disrupts valve formation. Despite this important role, little is known regarding how SOX9 regulates heart valve formation or its transcriptional targets. more...

(Submitter supplied) Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can spontaneously dedifferentiate into embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells, which are designated as multipotent SSCs (mSSCs), without ectopic expression of reprogramming factors. SSCs express key OSKM reprogramming factors at some levels, and do not require ectopic expression of any gene for the acquisition of pluripotency during reprogramming to mSSCs. Therefore, we reasoned that additional factors are required to regulate SSC reprogramming. more...

The data show a dose- and agonist-dependent involvement of CD14. Lack of CD14 impairs responses to low-dose challenegs with LPS, whereas high-dose challenegs are affected to a much lesser degree. For FN, CD14 deficiency causes a major impairment of the response capacity.

2282. Differences in murine miR-150-/- CD8+ T cells
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs are a major class of gene regulators in mammals.  While numerous aspects of the immune systems are controlled by miRNAs, their precise role in the CD8+ T cell response remains unclear.  In this report, we show that miR-150 is the most abundant miRNA expressed in CD8+ T cells and its expression is required for proper effector cell differentiation in response to acute and chronic pathogens.  In the absence of miR-150, CD8+ T cells failed to both undergo robust expansion and differentiate into short-lived terminal effector cells. The lack of miR-150 also altered the effector CD8+ T cell transcriptome such that, despite activation, genes associated with naïve or memory cells were highly expressed.  The deletion of miR-150 also reduced killing efficiency of CD8+ T cells.  These results uncover a cell-intrinsic role for miR-150 in the regulation of CD8+ T cell effector fate and function.

Rhythmic transcription underlies the core clock mechanism, but it cannot explain numerous observations made at the level of protein rhythmicity. We have used ribosome profiling in mouse liver to measure the translation of mRNAs into protein around-the-clock and at high temporal and nucleotide resolution. Transcriptome-wide, we discovered extensive rhythms in ribosome occupancy, and identified a core set of ≈150 mRNAs subject to particularly robust daily changes in translation efficiency. more...

2352. mRNA- and RISC-sequencing of mouse hearts overexpressing miR-378a
(Submitter supplied) Rationale: MicroRNAs play key roles in hypertrophic stress responses. miR-378(-3p) is a highly abundant, cardiomyocyte-enriched microRNA whose downregulation in pressure-overload has been suggested as detrimental to the heart. Previous studies have utilized systemic anti-miR or microRNA-encoding virus administration, and thus questions regarding the cardiomyocyte-autonomous roles of miR-378 remain.  Objective: To examine whether persistent overexpression of miR-378 in cardiomyocytes alters the phenotype of the unstressed heart, whether its overexpression is beneficial or deleterious in the setting of pressure-overload, and to comprehensively identify its cardiomyocyte-specific effects on mRNA regulation.  Methods and Results: Cardiac function was compared in young (10-12 week-old) mice overexpressing miR-378 in the heart under the control of the Myh6 promoter (alphaMHC-miR-378 mice), in older (40 week-old) mice and their age-matched wild-type controls. Older alphaMHC-miR-378 mice exhibited decreased fractional shortening and modest chamber dilation with an increase in cardiomyocyte length. When subjected to pressure-overload, cardiomyocyte length was increased in young alphaMHC-miR-378 mice, but fractional shortening declined precipitously over two weeks. Transcriptome profiling of wild-type and alphaMHC-miR-378 hearts in unstressed and pressure-overload conditions revealed dysregulation of several upstream metabolic and mitochondrial genes in alphaMHC-miR-378 hearts, compromising the reprogramming that occurs during early adaptation to pressure overload. Ago2 immunoprecipitation with mRNA sequencing revealed novel miR-378 cardiac mRNA targets including Akt1 and Epac2 and demonstrated the contextual nature of previously described miR-378 targeting events.  Conclusions: Long-term upregulation of miR-378 levels in the heart is not innocuous and exacerbates contractile dysfunction in pressure-overload hypertrophy through numerous signaling mechanisms.

(Submitter supplied) Recurrent mutations in the spliceosome are observed in several human cancers but their functional and therapeutic significance remain elusive. SF3B1, the most frequently mutated component of the spliceosome in cancer, is involved in the recognition of the branch point sequence (BPS) during selection of the 3’ splice site (ss) in RNA splicing. Here, we report that common and tumor-specific splicing aberrations are induced by SF3B1 mutations and establish aberrant 3’ ss selection as the most frequent splicing defect. more...

We demonstrate that the microRNA-212/132 cluster (miR-212/132) is induced in B cells in response to B cell receptor signaling. Enforced expression of miR-132 results in a block in early B cell development at the pre-pro-B cell to pro-B cell transition and induces apoptosis in primary bone marrow B cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is characterized by anemia and cancer susceptibility, and is caused by mutations in ribosomal genes, including Rpl11. Here, we report that Rpl11-heterozygous embryos are not viable, and homozygous deletion of Rpl11 in adult mice results in death within a few weeks, accompanied by bone marrow aplasia and intestinal atrophy. Importantly, deletion of a single Rpl11 allele in adult mice results in anemia associated to decreased erythroid progenitors and defective erythroid maturation. more...

2436. Distinct murine mucosal Langerhans cell subsets develop from pre-DCs and monocytes
(Submitter supplied) Langerhans cells (LCs) populate the mucosal epithelium, a major entry portal for pathogens, yet their ontogeny remains unclear. In contrast to skin LCs originating from self-renewing radioresistant embryonic precursors, we found that oral mucosal LCs derive from circulating radiosensitive precursors. Mucosal LCs can be segregated into CD103+CD11blow (CD103+LCs) and CD11b+CD103- (CD11b+LCs) subsets. We further demonstrated that similar to non-lymphoid dendritic cells (DCs), CD103+LCs originate from pre-DCs, whereas CD11b+LCs differentiate from both pre-DCs and monocytic precursors. Despite this ontogenetic discrepancy between skin and mucosal LCs, transcriptomic signature and immunological function of oral LCs highly resemble those of skin LCs but not DCs. These findings, along with their epithelial position, morphology and expression of LC-associated phenotype strongly suggest that oral mucosal LCs are genuine LCs. Collectively, in a tissue-dependent manner, murine LCs differentiate from at least three distinct precursors (embryonic, pre-DCs and monocytic) in steady state

Here, we use the murine spared-nerve injury model of neuropathic pain to investigate the mechanism by which RGS9-2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region involved in mood reward and motivation, modulates the actions of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Prevention of RGS9-2 action in the NAc increases the efficacy of the TCA desipramine and dramatically accelerates its onset of action. more...

They not only provide physical and nutritional support but also secrete factors essential to the complex developmental processes of germ cell proliferation and differentiation. The SC transcriptome must therefore adapt rapidly during the different stages of spermatogenesis.

We uncover a double negative feedback loop between interferon regulatory factors IRF4 and IRF8, which regulates the initial bifurcation of activated B cells as well as the GC response. IRF8 dampens BCR signaling, facilitates antigen specific interaction with helper T cells, and promotes selection of high affinity clones while antagonizing IRF4 driven plasmablast differentiation. more...

2463. RNA-Seq of Ctcfl transgenic mouse ES cells
(Submitter supplied) Ctcfl, a paralog of Ctcf, also known as BORIS (Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites), is a testis expressed gene whose function is largely unknown. As a cancer testis antigen, it is often expressed in tumor cells and also seen in two benign human vascular malformations, juvenile angiofibromas (JA) and infantile hemangiomas (IH). To better understand the function of Ctcfl we created tetracycline-inducible Ctcfl transgenic mice. more...

2464. Single-Cell mRNA Sequencing Reveals Rare Intestinal Cell Types
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating sub-populations of cells are based on mRNA or protein expression of only few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumor cells is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. more...

2512. Conversion of MyoD to a neurogenic factor: binding site specificity determines lineage [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) MyoD and NeuroD2 are master regulators of myogenesis and neurogenesis and bind to a "shared" E-box sequence (CAGCTG) and a "private" sequence (CAGGTG or CAGATG, respectively). To determine whether private-site recognition is sufficient to confer lineage-specification, we generated a MyoD-mutant with the DNA binding specificity of NeuroD2. Our results demonstrate that redirecting MyoD binding from MyoD-private sites to NeuroD2-private sites, despite preserved binding to the MyoD/NeuroD2-shared sites, is sufficient to change MyoD from a master regulator of myogenesis to a master regulator of neurogenesis.

(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor RUNX1 is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. RUNX1 mutations can be early events, creating pre-leukemic stem cells that expand in the bone marrow. Here we show that, counter-intuitively, Runx1 deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a slow growth, low biosynthetic, small cell phenotype and markedly reduced ribosome biogenesis (Ribi). more...

2535. Regulatory T cells from colonic lamina propria [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The colonic lamina propria contains a distinct population of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) that modulate responses to commensal microbes. Analysis of gene expression revealed that the transcriptome of colonic Tregs is distinct from splenic and other tissue Tregs. Rorγ and Helios in colonic Tregs mark distinct populations: Rorγ+Helios- or Rorγ-Helios+ Tregs. We uncovered an unanticipated role for Rorγ, a transcription factor generally considered to be antagonistic to Foxp3. more...

(Submitter supplied) Understanding factors that drive development and function of the sinoatrial node (SAN) is crucial to development of potential therapies for sinus arrhythmias, including potential generation of biological pacemakers. Here, we identify a key cell autonomous role for the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ISL1 for survival, proliferation and function of pacemaker cells throughout development. Analysis of several Isl1 mutant mouse lines, including one in which Isl1 was specifically ablated in SAN (Hcn4- CreERT2;Isl1) revealed an early requirement for Isl1 within SAN for embryonic viability. more...

2537. Viral nucleases reveal an mRNA degradation-transcription feedback loop in mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) Gamma-herpesviruses encode a cytoplasmic mRNA-targeting endonuclease, termed SOX, that cleaves the majority of mRNAs within a cell.  Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular mRNA degradation machinery.  Here, we reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus.  Measurements of both RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. more...

Using genetic deletion of the CNOT3 subunit of this complex in early B cell progenitors, we show that CNOT3 plays a critical role in pro- to pre-B cell transition. CNOT3 participated in controlling germline transcription, compaction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus, and Igh rearrangement, and in destabilizing tumor suppressor p53 mRNA. more...

Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

Using an inbred mouse neuronal phenotypic screen, we find that CAST/Ei mouse adult dorsal root ganglion neurons extend axons more on CNS myelin than the other eight strains tested, especially when pre-injured.  Injury-primed CAST/Ei neurons also regenerate markedly in the spinal cord and optic nerve more than those from C57BL/6 mice and show greater spouting following ischemic stroke. more...

The carcinogenic effect of IR has been commonly attributed to the direct induction of DNA damage. We demonstrate that IR exposure results in long-term, somatically heritable, cell-intrinsic reductions in HSC self-renewal that is mediated by C/EBPα and reversed by Notch, both of which are associated with human leukemias. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tbx3, a member of the T-box family, plays important roles in development, stem cells, nuclear reprogramming and cancer. Loss of Tbx3 induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we show that mESCs exist in an alternate stable pluripotent state in the absence of Tbx3. In-depth transcriptome analysis of this mESC state reveals Dppa3 as a direct downstream target of Tbx3. Also Tbx3 facilitates the cell fate transition from pluripotent cells to mesoderm progenitors by directly repressing Wnt pathway members required for differentiation. more...

2582. RNA elements in precursors instruct directional and processive primary piRNA biogenesis
(Submitter supplied) PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are animal gonad-specific small RNAs that control the activity of transposable elements. Long single stranded RNAs from a variety of sources are substrates for the nebulous primary processing pathway that converts these into thousands of 24-30 nucleotide (nt) piRNAs. How these transcripts are selected as precursors is not known. Here we show that targeting a transcript with PIWI slicer activity of cysosolic Ago3 is sufficient to trigger ~30-nt waves of non-overlapping primary piRNAs in the fly ovarian germline. more...

(Submitter supplied) Genome stability relies on epigenetic mechanisms that enforce repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Current evidence suggests that distinct chromatin-based mechanisms repress ERVs in cells of embryonic origin (histone methylation-dominant) versus more differentiated cells (DNA methylation-dominant). However, the latter aspect of this model has not been tested. Remarkably, and in contrast to the prevailing model, we find that repressive histone methylation catalyzed by the enzyme SETDB1 is critical for suppression of specific ERV families and exogenous retroviruses in committed B-lineage cells from adult mice. more...

2600. Opposing Roles of STAT1 and STAT3 in IL-21 Function in CD4+ T cells
(Submitter supplied) Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a type 1 cytokine essential for immune cell differentiation and function. Although IL-21 can activate several STAT family transcription factors, previous studies focused mainly on the role of STAT3 in IL-21 signaling. Here, we investigated the role of STAT1 and show that STAT1 and STAT3 have at least partially opposing roles in IL-21 signaling in CD4+ T cells. IL-21 induced STAT1 phosphorylation, and this was augmented in Stat3-deficient CD4+ T cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Transcription factor-mediated reprogramming is a powerful method to study cell fate changes. In this work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Gata6 can initiate reprograming of multiple cell types to induced extraembryonic endoderm (iXEN) cells. Intriguingly, Gata6 is sufficient to drive iXEN cells from mouse pluripotent cells and differentiated neural cells. Furthermore, GATA6 induction in human ES (hES) cells also downregulates pluripotency gene expression and upregulates extraembryonic endoderm genes, revealing a conserved function in mediating this cell fate switch. more...

(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate and function.  Current m6A mapping approaches rely on immunoprecipitation of m6A-containing RNA fragments to identify regions of transcripts that contain m6A.  This approach localizes m6A residues to 100-200 nt-long regions of transcripts.  The precise position of m6A in mRNAs cannot be identified on a transcriptome-wide level because there are no chemical methods to distinguish between m6A and adenosine. more...

(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation at selective cytosine residues (5mC) and their removal by TET-mediated DNA demethylation are critical for setting up pluripotent states in early embryonic development. TET enzymes successively convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC, the later two of which are subject to removal by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in conjunction with base excision repair. Early reports indicate that 5fC and 5caC could be stably detected on enhancers, promoters, and gene bodies with distinct effects on gene expression, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. more...

Recent evidence suggest that several Nups have additional roles in controlling the activation and silencing of developmental genes, however, the mechanistic details of these functions remain poorly understood.

To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. more...

2634. Altered epigenetic programming links intestinal inflammation to colon cancer (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) This study uses whole-transcriptome sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of the AOM/DSS mouse model. In this model, mice are treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. When this treatment is preceded by injections of the weak carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) the mice develop intestinal tumors. Our results identify sets of differentially expressed genes which are correlated with methylation changes of the corresponding genes.

2637. Chromatin signature identifies monoallelic gene expression across mammalian cell types (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Monoallelic expression of autosomal genes (MAE) is a widespread epigenetic phenomenon which is poorly understood, due in part to current limitations of genome-wide approaches for assessing it. Recently, we reported that a specific histone modification signature is strongly associated with MAE, and demonstrated that it can serve as a proxy of MAE in human lymphoblastoid cells (Nag et al. Elife. 2013 Dec 31;2:e01256). more...

Defining cell-autonomous processes underlying BAT differentiation and activation may thus reveal novel therapeutic targets for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus intervention. Here we show that ageing- and obesity-associated demises in BAT function coincide with down-regulation of mature microRNAs in BAT in the presence of reduced expression of the critical microRNA processing enzyme Dicer1. more...

(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs are critical post-transcriptional regulators of hematopoietic cell-fate decisions, though little remains known about their role in aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The microRNA-212/132 cluster (miR-212/132) is enriched in HSCs and is up-regulated during hematopoietic aging. Both over-expression and deletion of microRNAs in this cluster leads to inappropriate hematopoiesis with age. Enforced expression of miR-132 in the bone marrow compartment of mice led to rapid HSC cycling followed by their depletion. more...

2671. HSA21 Single-minded 2 (Sim2) binding sites co-localize with super-enhancers and pioneer transcription factors in pluripotent mouse ES cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome (DS) results from trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21). Some DS phenotypes may be directly or indirectly related to the increased expression of specific HSA21 genes, in particular those encoding transcription factors. The HSA21 encoded Single-minded 2 (SIM2) transcription factor has key neurological functions and is a good candidate to be involved in the cognitive impairment of DS. ChIP-sequencing was used to map SIM2 binding in mouse embryonic stem cells and has revealed 1229 high-confidence SIM2-binding sites. more...

(Submitter supplied) IL-6 and IL-27 have antagonistic and overlapping functions, signal through a shared receptor subunit and employ the same downstream STAT proteins. To evaluate the degree of specificity and redundancy for these cytokines, we quantified global transcriptomic changes induced by the two cytokines and determined the relative contributions of STAT1 and STAT3 using genetic models and ChIP-seq. We found a high degree of overlap of the transcriptomes induced by IL-6 and IL-27 and extremely few examples in which the cytokines acted in opposition. more...

While combined reduction of Pax5 and Ebf1 dose had minimal impact on the development of the earliest CD19+ progenitors, these cells displayed an increased T-cell potential in vivo and in vitro. Alteration in lineage fate depended on a Notch1 mediated conversion process while no signs of de-differentiation could be detected. more...

2686. Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression
(Submitter supplied) The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life.  Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population.  Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC.  Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal.  This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

In contrast, we know much less about the function of the highly abundant and extremely diverse class of piRNAs, which partner with MIWI and MILI during meiosis. Both MIWI and its catalytic activity are required for successful spermatogenesis, strongly indicating that piRNA-guided cleavage is critical for germ cell development. more...

2703. Differential features of Aire-induced and Aire-independent promiscuous gene expression in thymic epithelial cells
(Submitter supplied) Promiscuous gene expression (pGE) of numerous self-antigens in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) enables the elimination of self-reactive T cells. The autoimmune regulator (Aire) is the only known molecular determinant driving pGE in the thymus but the existence of Aire-independent mechanisms has been inferred. Here, we analyzed the poly(A)+ transcriptome of TEC populations by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in order to reveal differential features of Aire-induced vs. more...

2738. BET Bromodomain Inhibition Suppresses the Function of Hematopoietic Transcription Factors in Acute Myeloid Leukemia [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein Brd4 is a validated drug target in leukemia, yet its regulatory function in this disease is not well understood. Here, we show that Brd4 chromatin occupancy in acute myeloid leukemia closely correlates with the hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) Pu.1, Fli1, Erg, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and Myb at nucleosome-depleted enhancer and promoter regions. We provide evidence that these TFs, in conjunction with the lysine acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP, facilitate Brd4 recruitment to their occupied sites to promote transcriptional activation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fbw7, the substrate recognition subunit of SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase, mediates turnover of multiple proto-oncoproteins and promotes its own degradation. Fbw7-mediated substrate degradation is antagonized by the Usp28 deubiquitinase. We now show, using knockout mice, that Usp28 preferentially deubiquitinates and stabilizes Fbw7. Monoallelic deletion of Usp28 maintains stable Fbw7 but destabilizes Fbw7 substrates. more...

(Submitter supplied) We recently identified the DNA repair complex XPC-RAD23B-CETN2 as a stem cell coactivator (SCC) required for OCT4 and SOX2 transcriptional activation. Here we investigate genome-wide the role of SCC in murine ESCs by mapping regions bound by its RAD23B subunit in wild type and Xpc-/- ESCs, and analyzing transcriptional profiles of SCC-depleted ESCs.

2769. Integrative Genomic Analysis Reveals Widespread Enhancer Regulation by p53 in Response to DNA Damage
(Submitter supplied) The tumor suppressor p53 has been studied extensively as a direct transcriptional activator of protein-coding genes.  Recent studies, however, have shed light on novel regulatory functions of p53 within noncoding regions of the genome.  Here, we use a systematic approach that integrates transcriptome-wide differential expression analysis, genome-wide p53 binding profiles, chromatin state maps, and additional genomic features to characterize the global regulatory roles of p53 in response to DNA damage in both human and mouse fibroblast models. more...

2771. RAR/RXR binding dynamics distinguishes pluripotency from differentiation-associated cis-regulatory elements
(Submitter supplied) In mouse embryonic cells, a retinoic acid (RA) stimulation triggers a massive change of gene expression leading the pluripotent, proliferating cells to a lineage-specific differentiation process. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) plays a key role in this response by inhibiting pluripotency-maintaining genes and simultaneously activating some major actors of cell differentiation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this dual regulation, we performed joint RAR/RXR ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq time series during the first 48 hours of the RA-induced Primitive Endoderm differentiation process in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. more...

2787. MIWI and piRNA-mediated cleavage of messenger RNAs in mouse testes
(Submitter supplied) The piRNA machinery is known for its role in mediating epigenetic silencing of transposons. Recent studies suggest that this function also involves piRNA-guided cleavage of transposon-derived transcripts. As many piRNAs also appear to have the capacity to target diverse mRNAs, this raises the intriguing possibility that piRNAs may act extensively as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNAs. To directly test this hypothesis, we compared mouse PIWI (MIWI)-associated piRNAs with experimentally identified cleaved mRNA fragments from mouse testes, and observed cleavage sites that predominantly occur at position 10 from the 5' end of putative targeting piRNAs. more...

2789. PU.1 regulates T-lineage gene expression and progression via indirect repression during early T-cell development
(Submitter supplied) The Ets family transcription factor PU.1 is essential for the development and maintenance of several hematopoietic lineages. In the thymus, PU.1 is expressed only in the early ETP/DN1, DN2a and DN2b stages of development. While PU.1 deletion in multipotent precursors leads to a complete block in T-cell development its function in the intrathymic stages in which it is expressed remains undetermined. The goal of this expression profiling study was to determine if PU.1 regulates the expression of T-lineage genes during the early stages of development. To do this, we generated the PU.1-Eng construct which expresses a fusion protein containing the DNA binding ETS domain of PU.1 (aas 159-260) fused to the obligate repressor domain (aas 1-298) of the Drosophila engrailed protein. The PU.1-ETS construct only expresses the ETS domain of PU.1 (aas 159-260) and serves as a control. Fetal liver precursors were isolated from e14.5 embryos and co-cultured with OP9-DL1 cells in the presence of IL-7 and Flt3L (5 ng/ml each) for 4 days to obtain FLDN1, DN2a and DN2b cells. These were infected with vector only, PU.1-ETS and the PU.1-Eng constructs and DN2 cells were sorted after 20 hours of infection. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and polyA+ fraction was used to prepare libraries for high throughput sequencing. Libraries prepared from 2 independent sets of samples were subjected to non-strand specific single-end sequencing.

In this study, we showed that long-term hematopoietic stem cells are more amenable for iPS cells induction among several hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations, and that this is accompanied by an earlier induction of the transcriptional program that is involved in the promotion of macromolecule metabolism and cell proliferation. more...

2802. Jarid2 regulates hematopoietic stem cell function by acting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2
(Submitter supplied) Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) has been shown to play a key role in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function. Analyses of mouse mutants harboring deletions of core components have implicated PRC2 in fine-tuning multiple pathways that instruct HSPC behavior, yet how PRC2 is targeted to specific genomic loci within HSPCs remains unknown. Here we use shRNA-mediated knockdown to survey the function of known PRC2 accessory factors in HSPCs by testing the competitive reconstitution capacity of transduced murine fetal liver cells. more...

2804. Regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation by 3’ end processing and splicing factors
(Submitter supplied) Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) results in mRNA isoforms containing different 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) and/or coding sequences. How core cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) factors regulate APA is not well understood. Using siRNA knockdown coupled with deep sequencing, we found that several C/P factors can play significant roles in 3’UTR-APA. Whereas Pcf11 and Fip1 enhance usage of proximal poly(A) sites (pAs), CFI-25/68, PABPN1, and PABPC1 promote usage of distal pAs. more...

We show preferential down-regulation of super-enhancer-regulated neuronal function genes in the striatum of HD mice. Striatal super-enhancers display extensive H3K27 acetylation within gene bodies and drive transcription characterized by low levels of paused RNAPII. Down-regulation of gene expression is associated with diminished H3K27 acetylation and RNAPII recruitment. more...

In the E11.5 embryo trunk, we previously estimated that Prep1 binds about 3,300 genomic sites at a highly specific decameric consensus sequence, mainly governing basal cellular functions. We now show that in embryonic stem (ES) cells Prep1 binding pattern only partly overlaps that of the embryo trunk, with about 2,000 novel sites, highlighting a change of targets between embryonic differentiated v. more...

(Submitter supplied) Nervous system (NS) development relies on coherent up-regulation of extensive sets of genes in a precise spatiotemporal manner. How such transcriptome-wide effects are orchestrated at the molecular level remains an open question. Here we show that 3’-untranslated regions (3’UTRs) of multiple neuronal transcripts contain A/U-rich cis-elements (AREs) recognized by tristetraprolin (TTP/Zfp36), an RNA-binding protein previously reported to destabilize mRNAs encoding predominantly cytokines, growth factors and proto-oncogenes. more...

We previously found that Mecp2-null microglia are functionally impaired, and that engraftment of wild-type monocytes into the brain of Mecp2-deficient mice attenuates pathology. In this study we show that Mecp2 is expressed in macrophage and monocyte populations throughout the body, and is indispensable for their transcriptional regulation in multiple contexts. more...

Here we report that the BTB/POZ domain transcription factor PATZ1 (MAZR), previously known for its transcriptional suppressor functions in T lymphocytes, is a crucial regulator of p53. The novel inhibitory role of PATZ1 on the p53 protein marks it as a proto-oncogene. more...

MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that is proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but, despite numerous studies examining neuronal gene expression in MeCP2 mutants, no coherent model has emerged for how MeCP2 regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in the expression of long genes in neurons lacking MeCP2. more...

2820. The role of Tet3 in regulating gene expression in response to global synaptic activity changes
(Submitter supplied) Counter to the long-held belief that DNA methylation of terminally differentiated cells is permanent and essentially immutable, post-mitotic neurons exhibit extensive DNA demethylation. The causal role of active DNA demethylation in neurons, however, is not known. Tet family proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine to initiate active DNA demethylation through the base-excision repair pathway. Here, we show that synaptic activity bi-directionally regulates neuronal Tet3 expression. more...

Here we report the analysis of 12 whole genome bisulphite sequencing datasets across three different embryonic tissues/stages from mice with and without Rlf. We find that its absence has effects at thousands of differentially methylated regions.

2835. MEF2D drives photoreceptor development through a genome-wide competition for tissue-specific enhancers (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Organismal development requires the precise coordination of genetic programs to regulate cell fate and function. MEF2 transcription factors play essential roles in this process but how these broadly expressed factors contribute to the generation of specific cell types during development is poorly understood.  Here we show that despite being expressed in virtually all mammalian tissues, in the retina MEF2D binds to retina-specific enhancers and controls photoreceptor cell development. more...

2839. Linking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor with altered DNA methylation patterns and developmentally induced aberrant antiviral T cell responses [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Successfully fighting infection requires a properly tuned immune system. Recent epidemiological studies link exposure to pollutants that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) during development with poorer immune responses later in life. Yet, how developmental triggering of AHR durably alters immune cell function remains unknown. Using a mouse model, we show that developmental activation of AHR leads to long-lasting reduction in the response of CD8+ T cells during influenza virus infection, cells critical for resolving primary infection. more...

2851. Cancer-associated ASXL1 mutations may act as gain-of-function mutations of the ASXL1-BAP1 complex
(Submitter supplied) ASXL1 is the obligate regulatory subunit of a deubiquitinase complex whose catalytic subunit is BAP1. Heterozygous mutations of ASXL1 that result in premature truncations are frequent in myeloid leukemias and Bohring-Opitz syndrome. Here, we demonstrate that truncated ASXL1 proteins confer enhanced activity on the ASXL1-BAP1 complex. Stable expression of truncated, hyperactive ASXL1-BAP1 complexes in a hematopoietic precursor cell line resulted in global erasure of H2AK119Ub, striking depletion of H3K27me3, selective upregulation of a subset of genes whose promoters bore both H2AK119Ub and H3K4me3, and spontaneous differentiation to the mast cell lineage. more...

(Submitter supplied) The global impact of DNA methylation on alternative splicing is largely unknown. Using a genome-wide approach in wild-type and methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells, we found that DNA methylation can act both as an enhancer and as a silencer of splicing, and affects the splicing of more than 20% of alternative exons. These exons are characterized by distinct genetic and epigenetic signatures. Alternative splicing regulation of a subset of these exons can be explained by Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which silences or enhances exon recognition in a position-dependent manner. more...

2867. MRTF-SRF signaling is required for seeding of HSC/Ps in bone marrow during development
(Submitter supplied) Chemokine signaling is important for the seeding of different sites by hematopoietic stem cells during development. Serum Response Factor (SRF) controls multiple genes governing adhesion and migration, mainly by recruiting members of the Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor (MRTF) family of G-actin regulated cofactors. We used vav-iCre to inactivate MRTF-SRF signaling early during hematopoietic development. more...

(Submitter supplied) It is now well established that the E- and Id-protein axis regulates multiple steps in lymphocyte development. However, it remains unknown as to how E- and Id-proteins mechanistically enforce and maintain the naïve T cell fate. Here we show that Id2 and Id3 suppressed the development and expansion of innate-variant TFH cells. Innate-variant TFH cells required MHC Class I-like signalling and were associated with germinal center B cell development. more...

2901. c-Myc Transcriptionally Amplifies Sox2 Target Genes to Regulate Self-Renewal in Multipotent Otic Progenitor Cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) An immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cell was generated by transient expression of c-Myc in Sox2-expressing otic progenitor cells. The procedure activated endogenous c-Myc expression in the cells and amplified existing Sox2-dependent transcripts to promote self-renewal. Downregulation of c-Myc expression following growth factor withdrawal resulted in a molecular switch from self-renewal to otic differentiation.

2903. Conserved epigenomic signatures between mouse and human elucidate immune basis of Alzheimer's disease
(Submitter supplied) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe1 age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, and cognitive decline.  Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized.  Here, we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mammals differ more than hundred fold in maximum lifespan, which can be altered in either direction during evolution, but the molecular basis for natural changes in longevity is not understood. Divergent evolution of mammals also led to extensive changes in gene expression within and between lineages. To understand the relationship between lifespan and variation in gene expression, we carried out RNA-seq-based gene expression analyses of liver, kidney and brain of 33 diverse species of mammals. more...

However, most noncoding RNA (ncRNA) is rapidly degraded after transcription, and relatively few have established functions, questioning the significance of this observation. Here we show that esBAF, a SWI/SNF family nucleosome remodeling factor, suppresses transcription of ncRNAs from approximately 57,000 nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) throughout the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). more...

2914. Multiple Arkadia/RNF111 structures coordinate its Polycomb body association and transcriptional control
(Submitter supplied) The RING domain protein Arkadia/RNF111 is a ubiquitin ligase in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway. We previously identified Arkadia as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-binding protein with clustered SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) that together form a SUMO-binding domain (SBD). However, precisely how SUMO interaction contributes to the function of Arkadia was not resolved. Through analytical molecular and cell biology, we found that the SIMs share redundant function with Arkadia's M domain, a region distinguishing Arkadia from its paralogs ARKL1/ARKL2 and the prototypical SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) RNF4. more...

Extracellular signals (e.g. TCR, CD28, IL-2R) are necessary for the generation and maintenance of Tregs, but how these signals are integrated to control the gene expression patterns of Tregs is less clear. Here we show that the epigenetic regulator, Ezh2, was induced by CD28 costimulation and Ezh2 activity was elevated in Tregs as compared to conventional CD4+ T cells. more...

2918. Effect of SF3A1 inhibition on pre-mRNA splicing
(Submitter supplied) We previously found that the SF3A mRNA splicing complex was required for a robust innate immune response; SF3A acts in part by inhibiting the production of a negatively acting splice form of the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88. Here we inhibit SF3A1 using RNAi and subsequently perform an RNAseq study to identify the full complement of genes and splicing events regulated by SF3A in murine macrophages. Surprisingly, SF3A has substantial specificity for mRNA splicing events in innate immune signaling pathways compared to other pathways, affecting the splicing of many genes in the TLR signaling pathway to modulate the innate immune response.

Here we present evidence that Yap activation is insufficient to promote growth in the otherwise normal tissue. Using a mosaic mouse model, we demonstrate that Yap overexpression in a fraction of hepatocytes does not lead to their clonal expansion, as proliferation is counterbalanced by increased apoptosis. more...

(Submitter supplied) To examine Ikaros tumor suppressor mechanisms, we have utilized inducible RNAi to dynamically restore endogenous Ikaros expression in T-ALL driven by its knockdown. This causes rapid transcriptional repression of Notch1 and associated targets including Myc, even in leukemias harboring spontaneous activating Notch1 mutations (producing aberrant ICN1) similar to those found in 60% of human T-ALL.

2934. Expression profiling of mouse T-ALL (Vav-tTA;TRE-GFP-shIkaros primary leukemia ALL211) cells following Ikaros restoration
(Submitter supplied) To examine Ikaros tumor suppressor mechanisms, we have utilized inducible RNAi to dynamically restore endogenous Ikaros expression in T-ALL driven by its knockdown. This causes rapid transcriptional repression of Notch1 and associated targets including Myc, even in leukemias harboring spontaneous activating Notch1 mutations (producing aberrant ICN1) similar to those found in 60% of human T-ALL. Ikaros restoration results in sustained regression of Notch1-wild type leukemias while endogenous or engineered ICN1 expression promotes rapid disease relapse, indicating that ICN1 functionally antagonizes Ikaros in T-ALL.

(Submitter supplied) Whole-exome sequencing studies have implicated chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the identification of de novo loss of function mutations in affected individuals. Many of these genes are co-expressed in mid-fetal human cortex, suggesting ASD risk genes converge in regulatory networks that are perturbed in ASD during neurodevelopment. To elucidate such networks we mapped promoters and enhancers bound by the chromodomain helicase CHD8, which is strongly enriched in ASD-associated de novo loss of function mutations, using ChIP-seq in mid-fetal human brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs), and embryonic mouse cortex. more...

2956. Transcriptome profile of oocytes expressing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of Ago2
(Submitter supplied) The RNase III enzyme DICER generates both microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs). Dicer deletion in mouse oocytes leads to female infertility due to defects during meiosis I. Because miRNA function is suppressed in mouse oocytes, it has been proposed that endo-siRNAs may have a role during female meiosis. By utilizing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of AGO2 specifically in oocytes, we disrupt the function of siRNAs and analyze the transcriptome of these oocytes in comparison with Ago2 null, and Dicer null oocytes.

2968. X-chromosome dynamics revealed by the RNA interactome and chromosomal binding of CTCF
(Submitter supplied) CTCF is a master regulator that plays a role in genome architecture and gene expression. A key aspect of CTCF’s mechanism involves bringing together distant genetic elements for intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions. Evidence from epigenetic processes, such as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), suggests that CTCF may carry out its functions through interacting RNAs. Using genome-wide approaches to investigate the relationship between CTCF’s RNA interactome and its epigenomic landscape, here we report that CTCF interacts with thousands of transcripts in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), many in close proximity to CTCF’s genomic binding sites. more...

2972. TRIM28 silences endogenous retroviruses in neural progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Here we show that in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) TRIM28 silences transcription of two groups of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs): IAP1 and MMERVK10C. Derepression of ERVs in Trim28-deficient NPCs was associated with a loss of H3K9me3 and resulted in transcriptional upregulation and reverse transcription. These findings demonstrate a unique dynamic transcriptional regulation of ERVs in NPCs.

Cell 5:19-25, 1974; ATCC CL-173), in which adipogenic differentiation is experimentally induced when quiescent 3T3-L1 cells are incubated with serum and IDX (insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine). Following IDX addition, the cells retract and re-enter the cell cycle in the so-called clonal expansion phase. Two to three days later the cells definitively exit the cell cycle, express adipocyte-specific genes, and accumulate lipids to form lipid droplets.

Here, we profiled the transcriptome of purified long-term HSCs by deep RNA-sequencing and identified thousands of un-annotated transcripts of which 323 are predicted to be lncRNAs. Comparison of their expression in differentiated lineages represented by B cells (B220+) and Granulocytes (Gr1+), revealed that 159 are likely to be HSC-specific. more...

3001. LincRNA-p21 Blocks Somatic Cell Reprogramming by Sustaining H3K9me3 and CpG Methylation at Pluripotent Gene Promoters
(Submitter supplied) Through expression profiling and functional screening we have identified the large intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) as a barrier for reprogramming. LincRNA-p21 is induced by p53 but contrary to its role in the DNA damage response it does not promote apoptosis or cell senescence in reprogramming. Instead, lincRNA-p21 associates with the H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1 and the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 in separate complexes that are facilitated by the RNA binding protein hnRNP-K.

(Submitter supplied) We identified binding sites of the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1 in the mouse podocyte genome in vivo by ChIP-seq. Furthermore, we provide a podocyte transcriptome derived from primary podocytes that were isolated by FACS on mouse glomeruli. In short, we show that WT1 activates a highly specific podocyte transcriptome by binding to putative podocyte-specific enhancers and TSS of target genes. Genes bound by WT1 in podocytes include the majority of genes mutated in hereditary podocytopathies as well as components of the slit diaphragm, actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and within endocytosis pathways. Furthermore, we infer a podocyte TF network from DNA-binding motifs enriched at WT1-bound loci that includes Tead, Lmx1b, Mafb, Tcf21, and Fox-class transcription factors.

3033. Cell-autonomous transformation of Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells into gastric stem cells upon loss of transcription factor Cdx2
(Submitter supplied) Stomach and intestinal adult epithelia harbor stem cells that are responsible for their continuous regeneration. Stomach and intestinal stem cells differ in their differentiation program and in the gene repertoire that they express. We show that single adult Lgr5-positive stem cells, isolated from 3D cultured small intestinal organoids, require Cdx2 to maintain their intestinal identity and are converted cell-autonomously into stomach-pyloric stem cells in the absence of this transcription factor.

3036. The Sm protein methyltransferase PRMT5, is not required for primordial germ cell specification in mice
(Submitter supplied) PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase with roles in stem cell biology, reprogramming, cancer and neurogenesis. During embryogenesis in the mouse it was hypothesized that PRMT5 functions with the master germline determinant BLIMP1 to promote primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Using a Blimp1-Cre germline conditional knockout, we discovered that Prmt5 has no major role in murine germline specification, or the first global epigenetic reprogramming event involving depletion of cytosine methylation from DNA and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation from chromatin. more...

3041. Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells.
(Submitter supplied) Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates, but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis. These findings illuminate the causes of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs and their consequences for cellular decision-making.

3070. Epigenetic memory of the first cell fate decision prevents complete ES cell reprogramming into trophoblast [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming of ES cells towards the trophoblast lineage, and specifally into self-renewing TS cells, can seemingly be achieved by manipulation of transcription factors such as Cdx2 and Oct4, or modulation of signalling cascades, notably Ras signalling. Here we analyze the arising cells from such treatment in detail for the efficiency and completeness of the reprogramming process. We find that the reprogrammed cells retain an epigenetic and transcriptional memory of their ES cell origin and are not equal to bona fide trophectoderm-derived TS cells.

3098. Leukemia stem cell-enriched population expresses self-renewal gene-expression signature [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program. more...

(Submitter supplied) The circadian clock in mammalian cells is cell-autonomously generated during the cellular differentiation process, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Here we show that perturbation of transcriptional program by constitutive expression of c-Myc and Dnmt1 ablation disrupts the differentiation-coupled emergence of the clock from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Using these model ESCs, 484 genes are identified by global gene expression analysis as correlating factors with differentiation-coupled circadian clock development. more...

3107. Endogenous miRNA and target concentrations determine susceptibility to potential ceRNA competition, based on hierarchical binding affinities (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) Target competition (ceRNA crosstalk) within miRNA-regulated gene networks has been proposed to influence biological systems. To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. more...

3131. rd10 transcriptome analysis
(Submitter supplied) Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a photoreceptor disease that affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States. There are currently very limited treatment options and the prognosis for most patients is progressive vision loss. Unfortunately, the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of RP initiation and progression is still poorly understood. However, the development of animal models of RP, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, has provided an opportunity to study the underlying cellular and molecular changes of this disease. more...

3133. Genome-wide expression profiles in young and old mouse liver [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Aging is accompanied by physiological impairments, which, in insulin-responsive tissues, including the liver, predispose individuals to metabolic disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze genome-wide profiles of RNA and chromatin organization in the liver of young (3 months) and old (21 months) mice. Transcriptional changes suggest that de-repression of the nuclear receptors PPARα, PPARγ, and LXRα in aged mouse liver leads to activation of targets regulating lipid synthesis and storage, whereas age-dependent changes in nucleosome occupancy are associated with binding sites for both known regulators (forkhead factors and nuclear receptors) and for novel candidates associated with nuclear lamina (Hdac3 and Srf) implicated to govern metabolic function of aging liver. more...

Recent studies have suggested that Tet3-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA replication-dependent dilution both contribute to global paternal DNA demethylation, but demethylation of the maternal genome occurs via replication. Here we present genome-scale DNA methylation maps for both the paternal and maternal genomes of Tet3-depleted and/or DNA replication-inhibited zygotes. more...

3199. PRMT5 protects genomic integrity during global DNA demethylation in primordial germ cells and preimplantation embryos
(Submitter supplied) Primordial germ cells (PGCs) and preimplantation embryos undergo epigenetic reprogramming, which entails comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation. We found that PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during this process. Here we show that conditional loss of PRMT5 in early PGCs caused complete male and female sterility, which is preceded by upregulation of LINE1 and IAP transposons and DNA damage response. more...

3200. Transcriptome profiling of severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons
(Submitter supplied) Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an early onset, autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by loss of or mutation in SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1). Despite understanding the genetic basis underlying this disease, it is still not known why motor neurons (MNs) are selectively affected by the loss of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model for severe SMA, the RNA transcript profiles (transcriptomes) between control and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn-/-) mESC-derived MNs were compared in this study using massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). more...

3216. Setdb1 is required for persistence of H3K9me3 and repression of endogenous retroviruses in mouse primordial germ cells
(Submitter supplied) Transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is inhibited by de novo DNA methylation during gametogenesis, a process initiated after birth in oocytes and at ~E15.5 in prospermatogonia. Earlier in germline development however, the genome, including most retrotransposons, is progressively demethylated, with young ERVK and ERV1 elements retaining intermediate methylation levels. As DNA methylation reaches a low point in E13.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs) of both sexes, we determined whether retrotransposons are marked by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 using a recently developed low input ChIP-seq method. more...

3218. Integrating Genomics, Transcriptomics, and T-Cell Biology: An RNA-seq Atlas of the Murine CD4+ Transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) CD4+ cells are key regulators of the adaptive immune system and can be classified into two main groups: T helper cells (naive, Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells), and regulatory T cells, iTreg and nTreg cells). We performed mRNA-sequencing on these major CD4+ cell subtypes, and integrated multiple computational methods for analyzing gene/isoform expression, differential expression, and functional annotation. Our primary analysis not only provides evidence for the very high quality of the sequence data, but also reveals novel patterns of read distributions inside and adjacent to genes. We identify 168 novel transcripts, which are differentially expressed in the various CD4+ cell subtypes. Further, we identify a wealth of novel, uniquely differentially expressed 'signature' transcripts for each cell type.  nTreg  cells have the largest number of these, with 477 signature genes in total, of which 58 are transcription factors. The data is compiled into an easily accessible online database publically available at http://www.thelpercell.com.

3221. Hybrid mice reveal parent-of-origin and cis- and trans-regulatory effects in the retina
(Submitter supplied) A fundamental challenge in genomics is to map DNA sequence variants onto changes in gene expression. Gene expression is regulated by cis-regulatory elements (CREs, i.e., enhancers, promoters, and silencers) and the trans factors (e.g., transcription factors) that act upon them. A powerful approach to dissecting cis and trans effects is to compare F1 hybrids with F0 homozygotes. Using this approach and taking advantage of the high frequency of polymorphisms in wild-derived inbred Cast/EiJ mice relative to the reference strain C57BL/6J, we conducted allele-specific mRNA-seq analysis in the adult mouse retina, a disease-relevant neural tissue. more...

3228. Ribosome Profiling Reveals Pervasive Translation Outside of Annotated Protein-Coding Genes
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome profiling suggests that ribosomes occupy many regions of the transcriptome thought to be non-coding, including 5' UTRs and lncRNAs. Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. more...

3253. Genome-Wide Profiling of miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in Skeletal Muscle with Aging [mRNA]
(Submitter supplied) Skeletal muscle degenerates progressively, loses mass (sarcopenia) along in years, and leads to reduced physical ability, often causing secondary diseases such as diabetes and obesity. It is known that regulation of gene expression by microRNAs is a key event in muscle development and disease. To understand genome-wide changes in microRNAs and mRNAs during muscle aging, we sequenced microRNAs as well as mRNAs from mouse gastrocnemius muscles at two different ages (6 versus 24-month-old). more...

(Submitter supplied) CD25 (IL-2R) can be expressed on the surface of immune cells in the absence of other chains of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), which are indispensable for IL-2 signaling. We identified two novel mast cell subsets, characterized by the differential expression of surface CD25, and by the ability to produce different cytokines and to proliferate, both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that functional differences between the two mast cell populations were dependent on CD25 itself, which directly modulated mast cell proliferation and responses in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) PR-SET7-mediated histone-4 lysine-20 methylation has been implicated in mitotic condensation, DNA damage response and replication licencing. Here we show that PR-SET7 function in the liver is pivotal for maintaining genome integrity. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of PR-SET7 in mouse embryos resulted in G2 arrest followed by massive cell death and defect in liver organogenesis. Inactivation at postnatal stages caused cell duplication-dependent hepatocyte necrosis with unusual features of autophagy, termed "endonucleosis". more...

3267. Targeting Unique Metabolic Properties of Breast Tumor Initiating Cells
(Submitter supplied) Bulk cancer cell populations are known to display distinct metabolic properties compared to their normal counterparts. However, relatively little is known about heterogeneity of metabolic properties within tumors. In this study we show that, analogous to some normal stem cells, breast tumor initiating cells (TICs, also called cancer stem cells) have distinct metabolic properties compared to non-tumorigenic cancer cells (NTCs). more...

(Submitter supplied) The subcellular localization and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) supports functional differentiation between cellular compartments. In neuronal dendrites, local translation of mRNA provides a rapid and specific mechanism for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain brain disorders. Despite the importance of dendritic mRNA translation, little is known about which mRNAs can be translated in dendrites in vivo and when their translation occurs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mice deficient for miR-212/132 have been reported to show impaired mammary gland development. However, another miR-212/132-deficient line does not demonstrate any obvious defects in mammary gland organogenesis. The transcriptome analysis in the mammary gland of the previously reported miR-212/132-deficient line by deep RNA-seq revealed significantly deregulated expression of genes flanking Mir-212/132 locus, such as HIC1, implying that the mammary gland phenotype might not be only due to loss of miR-212/132

(Submitter supplied) In higher eukaryotes, the large numbers of nuclear-encoded tRNA genes partially ensure the robustness of cytoplasmic protein translation. Here we discover that a loss-of-function in n-Tr20, a member of the nuclear-encoded tRNA Arg UCU family that is expressed specifically in the central nervous systems leads to low but detectable levels of ribosome stalling. In the absence of GTPBP2, a novel binding partner of the ribosome recycling protein Pelota, ribosome stalling increases, leading to widespread neurodegeneration. more...

3300. Selective transcriptional regulation by Myc in cellular growth control and lymphomagenesis
(Submitter supplied) The c-myc proto-oncogene product, Myc, is a transcription factor that binds thousands of genomic loci. Recent work suggested that rather than up- and down-regulating selected groups of genes, Myc targets all active promoters and enhancers in the genome (a phenomenon termed "invasion") and acts as a general amplifier of transcription. However, the available data did not readily discriminate between direct and indirect effects of Myc on RNA biogenesis. more...

3310. Effect of LMP7 and MECL1-immunoproteasome subunits deficiency on the transcriptome of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(Submitter supplied) As regulators of protein degradation, proteasomes regulate practically all cellular functions. It is therefore logical to assume that replacement of the constitutive proteasome (CP) by its IFN-  inducible homolog immunoproteasome (IP) could have far reaching effects on cell function. Accordingly, recent studies have revealed important roles for IPs in immune cells beyond MHC I-peptide processing. Moreover, the expression of IPs in non-immune cells from non-inflamed tissues suggests that the involvement of IPs is not limited to the immune system. more...

3311. Role of LDB1 in the transition from chromatin looping to transcription activation
(Submitter supplied) Many questions remain about how close association of genes and distant enhancers occurs and how this is linked to transcription activation. In erythroid cells, LDB1 is recruited to the β-globin locus via LMO2 and is required for looping of the β-globin locus control region (LCR) to the active β-globin promoter. We show that the LDB1 dimerization domain (DD) is necessary and, when fused to LMO2 is sufficient, to completely restore LCR-promoter looping and transcription in LDB1 depleted cells. more...

Here we show that expression of Id2 and Id3 in Treg cells was required to suppress development of fatal inflammatory disease. We found that T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-driven signaling initially decreased the abundance of Id3, which led to the activation of a follicular regulatory T (TFR) cell–specific transcription signature. more...

The molecular mechanism underlying the development and survival of RORγt+ ILCs is not thoroughly understood. Here we show that Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8), a scaffolding protein involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration, is essential for the protective immunity against Citrobacter rodentium. more...

(Submitter supplied) Hypomorphic mutations of PAX5 occur in one third of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs), however their functional consequences remain undefined. Here we employ advanced transgenic RNAi in mice to suppress endogenous Pax5 expression in the hematopoietic compartment in vivo, which co-operates with activated STAT5 to induce B-ALL. In this model, restoring endogenous Pax5 expression in established B-ALL induces transcriptional and immunophenotypic changes reminiscent of normal B cell differentiation, disabling leukemia-initiating capacity and ultimately causing leukemia clearance.

3333. Early remodeling of the neocortex upon episodic memory encoding
(Submitter supplied) Understanding the mechanisms by which long-term memories are formed and stored in the brain represents a central aim of neuroscience. Prevailing theory suggests that long-term memory encoding involves early plasticity within hippocampal circuits, while reorganization of the neocortex is thought to occur weeks to months later to subserve remote memory storage. Here we report that long-term memory encoding can elicit early transcriptional, structural and functional remodeling of the neocortex. more...

3334. Dicer-microRNA-Myc circuit promotes transcription of hundreds of long noncoding RNAs
(Submitter supplied) Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate, and their mis-expression has been implicated in many diseases. While distinct polymerases generate messenger vs. noncoding ribosomal or tRNAs3, little is known about distinct mechanisms controlling lncRNA expression. Here we show that transcription of lncRNAs is quantitatively different from that of messenger RNAs (mRNAs)--as revealed by deficiency of Dicer (Dcr), a key ribonuclease that generates microRNAs (miRNAs). more...

(Submitter supplied) A few reports have implicated specific lncRNAs in cardiac development or failure, but precise details of lncRNAs expressed in hearts and how their expression may be altered during embryonic heart development or by adult heart disease is unknown. By comparing lncRNA profiles of normal embryonic (~E14), normal adult, and hypertrophied adult hearts we defined a distinct fetal lncRNA abundance signature that includes 157 lncRNAs differentially expressed compared to adults (fold-change ≥ 50%, FDR=0.02), and which was only poorly recapitulated in hypertrophied hearts (17 differentially expressed lncRNAs; 13 of these observed in embryonic hearts). more...

3337. piRNA pathway targets active LINE1 elements to establish repressive H3K9me3 mark in germ cells
(Submitter supplied) Transposable elements (TEs) occupy large fraction of metazoan genomes and pose constant threat to genomic integrity. This threat is particularly critical in germ cells, as changes in the genome that are induced by TEs will be transmitted to the next generation. Small non-coding piwi interacting (pi)RNAs recognize and silence a diverse set of TEs in germ cells. In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown. more...

(Submitter supplied) We report that a high affinity, selective, small molecule Gpr120 agonist (cpdA), exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vitro, and in obese mice in vivo. Gpr120 agonist treatment of high fat diet (HFD)/obese mice causes improved glucose tolerance, decreased hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic steatosis. This suggests that Gpr120 agonists could become new insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other human insulin resistant states in the future.

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms for block of erythropoiesis and increased myeloid potential, we used RNA-seq to reveal the differentially expressed genes from erythroid progenitors due to depletion of Rcor1.

3367. Histone variant H3.3 is an essential maternal factor for oocyte reprogramming
(Submitter supplied) Mature oocyte cytoplasm can reprogram somatic cell nuclei to the pluripotent state through a series of sequential events including protein exchange between the donor nucleus and ooplasm, chromatin remodeling, and pluripotency gene reactivation. Maternal factors that are responsible for this reprogramming process remain largely unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of histone variant H3.3 in mouse oocytes results in compromised reprogramming and down-regulation of key pluripotency genes; and this compromised reprogramming both for developmental potentials and transcription of pluripotency genes can be rescued by injecting exogenous H3.3 mRNA, but not H3.2 mRNA into oocytes in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos. more...

3368. Loss of Sip1 leads to migration defects and retention of ectodermal markers during lens development
(Submitter supplied) We report the application of  RNA-sequencing technology for the high-throughput profiling of mammalian lens gene expression at embryonic day 15.5.  The lens has a particularly biased transcriptome, with the top 50 genes encoding approximately 90% of the protein content.  Using RNA-Seq, we have shown that there are over 7,700 genes being expressed in the lens at embryonic day 15.5.  As expected, the crystallins and many structural genes were amoung the most highly expressed; however, numerous genes expressed at lower transcript abundance were also identified. more...

However, each LSP also detects a smaller set of isoforms which are characterized both by lower coverage and lower FPKM than that observed for the common ones among LSPs. This characteristic is particularly critical in case of low input RNA NuGEN v2 LSP. The effect of statistical detection of alternative splicing considering low input LSP (NuGEN v2) with respect to high input LSP (TruSeq) was studied using a benchmark dataset, in which both synthetic reads and reads generated from high and low input LSPs were spiked-in. more...

(Submitter supplied) The reprogramming of parental methylomes is essential for embryonic development. In mammals, paternal 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) have been proposed to be actively converted to oxidized bases. These paternal oxidized bases and maternal 5mCs are believed to be passively diluted by cell divisions. By generating single-base resolution, allele-specific DNA methylomes from mouse gametes, early embryos, and primordial germ cell (PGC), as well as single-base-resolution maps of oxidized cytosine bases for early embryos, we report the existence of 5hmC and 5fC in both maternal and paternal genomes and find that 5mC or its oxidized derivatives, at the majority of demethylated CpGs, are converted to unmodified cytosines independent of passive dilution from gametes to four-cell embryos. more...

3401. Increased expression of BubR1 protects against aneuploidy in aging oocytes and extends reproductive lifespan
(Submitter supplied) Chromosome aneuploidy increases in oocytes with maternal age, and is considered the leading cause for the increased incidence of infertility, miscarriage, and birth defects. Using mRNA-Sequencing of oocytes from 12 month old mouse versus 3 month young mouse, we identified a spindle assembly checkpoint gene, BubR1, whose expression was significantly decreased. We employed a mRNA microinjection based approach to increase BubR1 expression in aging oocytes. more...

3405. Antidiabetic Rosiglitazone Remodels the Adipocyte Transcriptome by Redistributing Transcription to PPARg-Driven Enhancers [HTS]
(Submitter supplied) Rosiglitazone (rosi) is a powerful insulin sensitizer, but serious toxicities have curtailed its widespread clinical use.  Rosi functions as a high-affinity ligand for PPARg, the adipocyte-predominant nuclear receptor (NR).  The classic model, involving binding of ligand to the NR on DNA, explains positive regulation of gene expression, but ligand-dependent repression is not well understood.  We have now addressed this issue by studying the direct effects of rosiglitazone on gene transcription, using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). more...

(Submitter supplied) Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying gene expression heterogeneity in populations of cells. Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a microfluidic platform for single-cell whole transcriptome analysis. more...

3409. Assessing the ceRNA hypothesis with quantitative measurements of miRNA and target abundance
(Submitter supplied) Recent studies have reported that competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) can act as sponges for a miRNA through their binding sites and that changes in ceRNA abundances from individual genes can modulate the miRNA’s activity. Consideration of this hypothesis would benefit from knowing the quantitative relationship between a miRNA and its endogenous target sites. Here, we altered intracellular target-site abundance through expression of a miR-122 target in hepatocytes and livers, and analyzed the effects on miR-122 target genes. more...

3410. Cell cycle dependence of neuroprogenitor fate determination regulated by Trrap-mediated histone acetylation
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic control of neural stem/progenitor cell fate is fundamental to achieve a fully brain architecture. Two intrinsic programs regulate neurogenesis, one by epigenetic-mediated gene transcription and another by cell cycle control. Whether and how these two are coordinated to determine temporally and spatially neural development remains unknown. Here we show that deletion of Trrap (Transcription translation associated protein), an essential cofactor for HAT (histone acetyltransferase), leads to severe brain atrophy due to a combination of cell death and a blockade of neuron production. more...

We collected over 190 million sequencing reads and identified many highly enriched protein coding mRNAs. Gene ontology analysis of enriched genes reveals that transcription factors and intercellular signaling proteins account for a large fraction of the targets, many of which are important for pluripotency and differentiation.

Through comparative analysis of 10 key haematopoietic TFs in both mast cells and blood progenitors, we demonstrate that the largely cell-type specific binding profiles are not opportunistic, but instead contribute to cell-type specific transcriptional control, because (1) mathematical modelling of differential binding of shared TFs can explain differential gene expression, (2) cell-type specific binding is largely mediated through consensus binding sites, and (3) knock-down of blood stem cell regulators Gata2 and Erg in mast cells reveals mast cell specific genes as direct targets. more...

3429. Triplication of a 21q22 region contributes to B cell transformation through HMGN1 overexpression and loss of histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Down syndrome (DS) confers a 20-fold increased risk of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet the mechanisms underlying this association are undefined.  We show that triplication of only 31 genes orthologous to the putative DS Critical Region (DSCR) on chr.21q22 is sufficient to promote B cell-autonomous self-renewal, in vivo maturation defects and leukemogenesis in concert with BCR-ABL.  DSCR triplication results in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) hypomethylation at gene promoters and a transcriptional signature characterized by de-repression of genes targeted by polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), which methylates H3K27.  The same signature is highly enriched among human DS-associated ALLs.  Pharmacologic inhibition of PRC2 function is sufficient to confer self-renewal in wild-type B cells while inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylases completely blocks self-renewal induced by DSCR triplication.  Finally, overexpression of the DSCR factor HMGN1, a nucleosome remodeling protein that suppresses H3K27me3, is necessary for self-renewal in B cells with DSCR triplication.

(Submitter supplied) Here we have used a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches to investigate the extent and mechanisms of transcription factor cross-talk at genomic hotspots. We identify ~12,000 transcription factor hotspots in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate for the first time that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions and that these drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. more...

3434. Chemical Inhibition of the RORγt-dependent Transcriptional Network in Th17 cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) RORγt is a transcription factor required for T helper 17 (Th17) cell development. We identified three RORγt-specific inhibitors that suppress Th17 cell responses including Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We systemically characterized RORγt binding data in the presence and absence of drug with corresponding whole-transcriptome sequencing for wild-type and RORγt-deficient cells. RORγt is central in a densely interconnected regulatory network, acting both as a direct activator of genes important for Th17 cell differentiation and as a direct repressor of genes from other T-cell lineages. more...

3436. Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) Analysis Uncovers Broad Changes in Chromatin Structure Resulting from Hexavalent Chromium Exposure
(Submitter supplied) The ability of chromatin to switch back and forth from open euchromatin to closed heterochromatin is vital for transcriptional regulation and genomic stability, and subject to disruption by exposure to environmental agents such as hexavalent chromium. Cr(VI) exposure can cause chromosomal disruption through formation of Cr-DNA adducts, free radical-induced DNA damage, and DNA-Cr-protein and DNA-Cr-DNA cross-links, all of which may disrupt chromatin remodeling mechanisms responsible for maintenance or controlled modification of epigenetic homeostasis. more...

(Submitter supplied) miR-181a1/b1, miR-181a2/b2, and miR-181c/d belong to a highly conserved family of microRNA clusters, yet their role in vivo is poorly understood. Here we show that the miR-181a1/b1 cluster is absolutely essential for NKT development and is a critical determinant of thymocyte proliferation, survival and T-cell receptor α locus rearrangement. Furthermore, while individual ablation of miR-181a2/b2 and miR-181c/d revealed no overt phenotypes, compound mutant mice lacking both miR-181a1/b1 and miR-181a2/b2 display decreased survival, reduced body weight, and abnormal B cell development. more...

3447. A role for H3K4 mono-methylation in facultative heterochromatin assembly and partitioning of chromatin readers
(Submitter supplied) Mono-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1) is a well-established feature of enhancers and promoters, although its function is unknown. Remarkably, we find H3K4me1 at the promoter regions of conditionaly-repressed muscle and stimulus-dependent inflammatory response genes in myoblasts. During myogenesis, muscle genes are activated and become H3K4-trimethylated. On the promoters of active genes, we find that H3K4me1 spatially restricts the recruitment of “readers” of H3K4me3, including ING1, which, in turn, recruits Sin3A. more...

3460. Rbfox2 controls autoregulation in RNA binding protein networks
(Submitter supplied) We generated a global analysis of Rbfox2 splicing regulation combined with a highly specific, single nucleotide-resolution Rbfox2 RNA binding map.  We found that Rbfox2 regulates the splicing and expression of many previously unknown targets, and particularly a number of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), by modulating alternative splicing coupled-NMD. Based on our observations of RBP-Rbfox2 co-regulation with a polarity predicted by Rbfox2 binding, we propose a model whereby Rbfox2 tunes autoregulatory splicing events to control RBP expression levels and in turn alter their respective splicing networks.

(Submitter supplied) Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are diseases caused by mutations in the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment. Most MPN patients have a common acquired mutation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in HSCs that renders this kinase constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell expansion. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment might contribute to the clinical outcomes of this common event. We previously showed that BM nestin+ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres regulate normal HSCs. more...

However, this process declines with age and this decline correlates with defects in cognitive function and mood. Molecular mechanisms that activate quiescent NSCs to generate progenitor cells in vivo remain poorly understood. Here we show that adult hippocampal NSCs express VEGFR3, a key regulator of vascular and neural development, and are activated by the VEGFR3 ligand VEGF-C to enter the cell cycle and convert into progenitor cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Interleukin 9 (IL-9) is a γc-family cytokine that is highly produced by T-helper 9 (Th9) cells and regulates a range of immune responses, including allergic inflammation. Here we show that IL-2–JAK3–STAT5 signaling is required for Th9 differentiation, with critical STAT5 binding sites in the Il9 (the gene encoding IL-9) promoter. IL-2 also inhibited B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) expression, and over- expression of BCL6 impaired Th9 differentiation. more...

(Submitter supplied) The preferential localization of some neoplasms, such as serrated polyps, in specific areas of the intestine suggests that non-genetic factors may be important for their development. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of transgenic mice that expressed HB-EGF throughout the intestine, but develop serrated polyps only in the cecum. Here we show that a host-specific microbiome was associated with serrated polyps, and that alterations of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment or by embryo-transfer rederivation markedly inhibited the formation of serrated polyps in the cecum. more...

3499. Stage-specific control of early B cell development by the transcription factor Ikaros
(Submitter supplied) Ikaros is an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis. Here, we studied the B-cell-specific function of Ikaros by conditional Ikzf1 inactivation in pro-B cells. B-cell development was arrested at an aberrant ‘pro-B’ cell stage characterized by increased cell adhesion and loss of pre-B cell receptor signaling. Ikaros was found to activate genes coding for pre-BCR signal transducers and to repress genes involved in the downregulation of pre-BCR signaling and upregulation of the integrin signaling pathway. more...

However, it remains elusive how these two events are integrated to ensure appropriate neural conversion. Here, we show that Oct6 functions as an essential positive factor for neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), specifically during the transition from epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to neural progenitor cells (NPCs). more...

The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. Here, we show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung cancer. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled in part by chromatin-modifying factors that regulate histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. However, it remains unclear how H3K4 demethylation contributes to ES cell function. Here, we show that KDM5B, which demethylates lysine 4 of histone H3, co-localizes with H3K4me3 near promoters and enhancers of active genes in ES cells; its depletion leads to spreading of H3K4 methylation into gene bodies and enhancer shores, indicating that KDM5B functions to focus H3K4 methylation at promoters and enhancers. more...

Here we show that Mll2, one of the six Set1/Trithorax-type H3K4 methyltransferases in mammals, is required for trimethylation of bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells. Mll2 is bound to bivalent promoters but also to most active promoters, which do not require Mll2 for H3K4me3 or mRNA expression. more...

It is activated by mutations in 20 to 40% of hepatocellular carcinomas with specific metabolic features.

3516. Distinct roles of Tet1 and Tet2 in mouse embryonic stem cells (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) The TET proteins TET1, TET2 and TET3 constitute a new family of dioxygenases that utilize molecular oxygen and the cofactors Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate to convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5hmC) and further oxidation products in DNA1-5. Here we show that Tet1 and Tet2 have distinct roles in regulating 5hmC deposition and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Tet1 depletion in mESC primarily diminishes 5hmC levels at transcription start sites (TSS), whereas Tet2 depletion is mostly associated with decreased 5hmC in gene bodies relative to TSS. 5hmC is enriched at exon start and end sites, especially in exons that are highly expressed, and is significantly decreased upon Tet2 knockdown at the boundaries of high-expressed exons that are selectively regulated by Tet2. In differentiating murine B cells, Tet2 deficiency is associated with selective exon exclusion in the gene encoding the transmembrane phosphatase CD45. Tet2 depletion is associated with increased 5hmC and decreased 5mC at promoters/ TSS regions, possibly because of the redundant activity of Tet1. Together, these data indicate a complex interplay between Tet1 and Tet2 in mESC, and show that loss-of-function of a single TET protein does not necessarily lead to loss of 5hmC and a corresponding gain of 5mC, as generally assumed. The relation between Tet2 loss-of-function and selective changes in exon expression could potentially explain the frequent occurrence of both TET2 loss-of-function mutations and mutations in proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing in myeloid malignancies in humans.

At least 19 genes are associated with LCA. While most LCA is recessive, mutations in the homeodomain transcription factor gene CRX lead to autosomal dominant LCA.

Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall.

3538. EZH2 controls mammary differentiation independently of its methyltransferase activity through controlling genomic STAT5 access
(Submitter supplied) Mammary development is characterized by the proliferation and progressive differentiation of alveolar epithelium during pregnancy, culminating in lactation. These processes are largely controlled by hormones through transcription factors. We now explore the contributions of histone methyltransferases, which establish H3K27me3 marks, in the temporally-regulated differentiation of mammary epithelium. Loss of EZH2, but not EZH1, resulted in precocious mammary differentiation, which was facilitated by STAT5 binding to specific target genes and their activation. Mammary stem cells were not compromised in the absence of EZH2. Genome-wide H3K27me3 patterns remained intact in the absence of EZH2. Mammary-specific loci were devoid of H3K27me3 marks in mammary progenitor and mature cells, suggesting no regulatory role for this repressive mark. Lastly, the combined absence of EZH1 and EZH2 inhibited the formation of alveoli. Taken together, EZH2 controls temporally-restricted differentiation of mammary epithelium through H3K27me3-independent mechanisms.

This report demonstrates that the combined loss of the histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 in mouse hepatocytes led to the disruption of H3K27me3 homeostasis by age three months, simple fatty liver by age six months and fatal fibrosis by age 15 months. more...

(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation plays critical roles in the nervous system and has been traditionally considered to be restricted to CpG dinucleotides in metazoan genomes. Here we show that the single-base resolution neuronal DNA methylome from the adult mouse dentate gyrus consists of both CpG (~75%) and CpH (~25%) methylation (H = A/C/T). Neuronal CpH methylation is conserved in human brains, enriched in low CpG-density regions, depleted at protein-DNA interaction sites, and anti-correlated with gene expression. more...

Current in vitro models rely on supplementation with the Wnt agonist R-spondin1 to support robust growth, ISC self-renewal, and differentiation. Intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) are important supportive cells within the ISC niche.

3551. Cohesin is a key determinant of interphase chromosome domain architecture (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. more...

3554. Lsh regulates LTR retrotransposon repression independent of Dnmt3b function (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Background: Global DNA methylation contributes to genomic integrity by supressing repeat associated transposition events. Several chromatin factors are required in addition to DNA methyltransferases to maintain DNA methylation at intergenic and satellite repeats. Embryos lacking Lsh, a member of the SNF2 superfamily of chromatin helicases, are hypomethylated. The interaction of Lsh with the de novo methyltransferase, Dnmt3b, facilitates the deposition of DNA methylation at stem cell genes. more...

3565. Role of SWI/SNF in acute leukemia maintenance and enhancer-mediated Myc regulation (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) Cancer cells frequently depend on chromatin regulatory activities to maintain a malignant phenotype. Here, we show that leukemia cells require the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex for their survival and aberrant self-renewal potential. While Brg1, an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, is known to suppress tumor formation in several cancer types, we found that leukemia cells instead rely on Brg1 to support their oncogenic transcriptional program, which includes Myc as one of its key targets. more...

The molecular basis of genomic imprinting is allele-specific DNA methylation 2. While it is well known that the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a/b are responsible for the establishment of genomic imprinting, how the methylation mark is erased during primordial germ cell (PGC) reprogramming remains a mystery. more...

3569. RNAseq analysis of alternative splicing in PTBP2 knockout mouse brain
(Submitter supplied) The splicing regulator PTBP2 controls a program of embryonic splicing required for neuronal maturation. The splicing regulatory proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2 show distinct temporal expression profiles in the developing brain. Neuronal progenitor cells predominantly express PTBP1, whereas developing neurons express high levels of PTBP2, which are subsequently reduced late in neuronal maturation. We show here that PTBP2 and the program of splicing it controls are essential to proper neuronal maturation and survival. more...

To understand mechanisms of splicing regulation, it is important to identify and characterize exon targets of splicing factors. Recently, development of RNA-seq technology enables researchers to investigate exon splicing profiles as well as gene expression profiles in transcriptome-wide. The goal of this study is to investigate transcriptome changes by splicing factors, Polypyrimidine Tract Binding proteins (PTB). more...

3571. Compound loss of muscleblind-like function in myotonic dystrophy
(Submitter supplied) Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multi-systemic disease that severely impacts cardiac and skeletal muscle functions as well as the central nervous system. DM is unusual because it is RNA-mediated disease due to the expression of C(C)UG expansion RNAs that inhibit the activities of the muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. In mice, studies using Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 single knockouts have revealed that Mbnl1 plays a predominant role in skeletal and heart muscle alternative splicing regulation while Mbnl2 performs an analogous splicing function in the brain. more...

Here we report a novel physiological function of TNF that extends its effect beyond the host into the developing offspring.  A partial/complete maternal TNF-deficit, specifically in hematopoietic cells, resulted in reduced milk levels of chemokines IP-10, MCP-1/-3/-5, and MIP-1β, which in turn, augmented offspring postnatal hippocampal proliferation, leading to improved adult spatial memory. more...

Thousands have been identified in mammals, yet only a few have been tested through genetic ablation in animal models. Of the few that have, many yields weak to unobservable phenotypes, raising the question of their in vivo relevance. To more broadly investigate the functional relevance of lincRNAs in physiological conditions, we developed a collection of 18 lincRNA knockout strains. more...

3576. The THO complex regulates pluripotency gene mRNA export to control embryonic stem cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming (RNA-IP)
(Submitter supplied) Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation is governed by a comprehensive regulatory network. Although the transcriptional regulation has been extensively investigated, post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling the ESC state are poorly understood. Here we describe a critical role of the THO complex in ESC self-renewal and differentiation. We show that THO preferentially interacts with pluripotency gene transcripts through Thoc5, and is required for self-renewal by regulating their export and expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are gonad-specific small RNAs that provide defence against transposable genetic elements called transposons. Our knowledge of piRNA biogenesis is sketchy, partly due to an incomplete inventory of the factors involved. Here, we identify Tudor domain-containing 12 (TDRD12; also known as ECAT8) as a novel piRNA biogenesis factor in mice. TDRD12 is detected in complexes containing MILI (PIWIL2), its associated primary piRNAs, and TDRD1, all of which are already implicated in secondary piRNA biogenesis. more...

As somatic cell reprogramming involves the re-activation of pluripotency genes and the silencing of somatic ones, it remains unclear the role of Tet1 in the reprogramming process. Here, we performed RNAseq for WT and knocking down Tet1 in two pre-iPSCs cell lines, pre2-2 and pre3.

3635. Hira-dependent histone H3.3 deposition facilitates PRC2 recruitment at developmental loci in ES cells [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates gene expression during lineage specification through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In Drosophila, polycomb binding sites are dynamic chromatin regions coupled to incorporation of the histone variant H3.3. Here we show in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that H3.3 is required for proper establishment of H3K27me3 at the promoters of developmentally regulated genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Taf7l (a paralogue of Taf7) and Trf2 (a TBP-related protein) are components of the core promoter complex required for gene/tissue-specific transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II. Previous studies reported that Taf7l knockout mice exhibit structurally abnormal sperm, reduced sperm count, weakened motility and compromised fertility. Here we find that continued backcrossing of Taf7l-/Y mice from N5 to N9 produced KO males that are essentially sterile. more...

Divergent regions in H2AZ are likely key for its functional specialization, but we know little about how these differences contribute to chromatin regulation.   Here, we show that the extended acidic patch, specifically the three divergent residues in the C-terminal docking domain, is necessary for lineage commitment during ESC differentiation and proper execution of gene expression programs during ESC differentiation. more...

3668. Co-ordinate inhibition of autism candidate genes by topoisomerase inhibitors [Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Topoisomerases are necessary for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, and are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have studied the effects of inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) enzymes on mouse cortical neurons. We find that topoisomerases selectively inhibit long genes (>100kb), with little effect on all other gene expression. Using ChIPseq against RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) we show that the Top1 inhibitor topotecan blocks transcriptional elongation of long genes specifically. more...

3670. Heterokaryon RNA Sequencing
(Submitter supplied) We report the application of bi-species RNAseq for investigating mechanisms of reprogramming towards pluripotency using heterokaryons (mouse embryonic stem cell X human fibroblast cell fusions). The use of mixed species allows one to monitor reprogramming of the human somatic nuclei independently of contributions from the mouse nuclei using nucleotide differences. We used RNAseq to monitor heterokaryon reprogramming over a 3-day timecourse, generating transcriptome-wide data for cell fusion based reprogramming of human fibroblasts towards pluripotency.

3671. A long noncoding RNA mediates both activation and repression of immune response genes.
(Submitter supplied) An inducible program of inflammatory gene expression is central to antimicrobial defenses. This response is controlled by a collaboration involving signal-dependent activation of transcription factors, transcriptional co-regulators, and chromatin-modifying factors. We have identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that acts as a key regulator of this inflammatory response. Pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors induce the expression of numerous lncRNAs. more...

3675. Targeted disruption of Hotair leads to homeotic transformation and de-repression of imprinted genes [RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to be prevalent regulators of gene expression, but the consequences of lncRNA inactivation in vivo are mostly unknown. Here we show that targeted deletion of mouse Hotair lncRNA leads to de-repression of hundreds of genes, resulting in homeotic transformation of the spine and malformation of metacarpal-carpal bones. RNA-seq and conditional inactivation reveal an ongoing requirement of Hotair to repress HoxD genes and multiple imprinted loci such as Dlk1-Meg3 and Igf2-H19. more...

Here we show that inhibition of Erk1/2 and Gsk3b signalling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by small molecule inhibitors (PD0325901 and CHIR99021, hereafter called 2i) induces genome-wide demethylation on a scale similar to that in PGCs and early embryos, with only major satellites, intracisternal A particles (IAPs) and imprinted genes relatively resistant to erasure. more...

3734. Muscleblind-like proteins regulate embryonic stem cell-specific alternative splicing and reprogramming II
(Submitter supplied) Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency have largely focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non- coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing (AS) represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in the regulation of ESC pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we identify the Muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of AS events that are differentially regulated between ESCs and other cell types. more...

ChIP followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful, unbiased method to map transfactor occupancy. We used ChIP-Seq to study the interactome of EKLF in mouse erythroid progenitor cells and more differentiated erythroblasts. We correlated these results with the nuclear distribution of EKLF, RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome, and the occupancy of other erythroid transcription factors. more...

In addition, many AHR target genes that have been identified by genome-wide profiling have morphogenetic functions, suggesting that AHR activation may play a role in embryonic development.  To address this hypothesis, we studied the consequences of AHR activation by TCDD, its prototypical ligand, during spontaneous mouse ES cell differentiation into contractile cardiomyocytes. more...

These four stages represent timepoints when differentiating cultures are enriched for embryonic stem cells (ESC), mesodermal cells (MES), cardiac precursors (CP), or cardiomyocytes (CM) respectively.  This study revealed many dynamic patterns of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns during differentiation.

(Submitter supplied) Nucleosomes are the principal packaging units of chromatin and critical for gene regulation and genome stability. In mammals, a subset of nucleosomes fail to be replaced by protamines during spermatogenesis and are retained in mature spermatozoa providing opportunities for paternal epigenetic transmission. In humans, the remaining 10% localize at regulatory elements of genes. To assess evolutionary conservation and to dissect the molecular logic underlying nucleosome retention, we determined the genome wide nucleosome occupancy in mouse spermatozoa that only contain 1% residual histones. more...

(Submitter supplied) The multisubunit TFIID plays a direct role in transcription initiation by binding to core promoter elements and directing preinitiation complex assembly. Although TFIID may also function as a coactivator through direct interactions with promoter-bound activators, mechanistic aspects of this poorly defined function remain unclear. Here biochemical studies show a direct TFIID-E protein interaction that (i) is mediated through interaction of a novel E protein activation domain (AD3) with the TAF homology (TAFH) domain of TAF4, (ii) is critical for activation of a natural target gene by an E protein and (iii) mechanistically, acts by enhancing TFIID binding to the core promoter. more...

(Submitter supplied) Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying mammalian touch transduction. To identify novel candidate transducers, we examined the molecular and cellular basis of touch in one of the most sensitive tactile organs in the animal kingdom, the star of the star-nosed mole. Our findings demonstrate that the trigeminal ganglia innervating the star are enriched in tactile-sensitive neurons, resulting in a higher proportion of light touch fibers and lower proportion of nociceptors compared to the dorsal root ganglia innervating the rest of the body. more...

3775. Roquin promotes constitutive mRNA decay via a conserved class of stem-loop recognition motifs.
(Submitter supplied) The degradation of TNFα mRNA is critical for restricting TNFα synthesis and involves a constitutive decay element (CDE) in the 3’ untranslated region of the mRNA. We demonstrate that the active CDE is a stem-loop RNA motif that is recognized by the RNA-binding protein Roquin. Deep sequencing of Roquin-associated mRNAs identified CDE-containing mRNAs as the primary targets of Roquin on a transcriptome-wide scale.

3776. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signalling status
(Submitter supplied) Notch signalling plays crucial roles in mediating cell fate choices in all metazoans largely by specifying the transcriptional output of one cell in response to a neighbouring cell. The DNA-binding protein RBPJ is the principle effector of this pathway in mammals and together with the transcription factor moiety of Notch (NICD) it regulates the expression of target genes. The prevalent view presumes that RBPJ statically occupies consensus binding sites while exchanging repressors for activators in response to NICD. more...

(Submitter supplied) The activation-induced cytidine deaminase enzyme (AID) is required in germinal center (GC) B cells for somatic hyper-mutation and class switch recombination at the immunoglobulin locus. In GC-B cells, AID is highly expressed, with inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity. However, AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically, irrespective of mutator activity, by directly deaminating 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in concert with base excision repair glycosylases to exchange unmethylated cytosine. more...

(Submitter supplied) We employed PAR-CLIP, a recently developed method based on   RNA-protein crosslinking, to identify Cirbp and Rbm3 binding sites at transcriptome-level. Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis indicated that cold temperature leads to extensive 3’UTR lengthening whereas the loss of Cirbp or Rbm3 resulted in 3’UTR shortening. Combining with   PAR-CLIP results, we found that these two RBPs repress the polyadenylation adjacent to their   binding sites.

(Submitter supplied) TET proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 5fC and 5caC are excised by mammalian DNA glycosylase TDG, implicating 5mC oxidation in DNA demethylation. Here we show that the genomic locations of 5fC can be determined by coupling chemical reduction with biotin tagging. Genome-wide mapping of 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveals that 5fC preferentially occurs at poised enhancers among other gene regulatory elements. more...

3794. Genome-wide non-polyadenylated transcription in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells reveals novel non-coding RNA related to pluripotency and differentiation
(Submitter supplied) The transcriptional landscape in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during ESC differentiation has received considerable attention in recent years, but reports have so far been confined to the polyadenylated fraction of RNA, while the non-polyadenylated (NPA) fraction remained largely unexplored. Notwithstanding, the NPA RNA super-family, which is mainly comprised of fundamental components of the RNA translational machinery, the RNA splicing machinery, and RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA interacting complexes, has every potential to participate in the regulation of pluripotency and stem cell fate. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tet1 is a hydroxylase known for its role in the conversion of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) involved in the possible active demethylation process and gene expression regulation. As somatic cell reprogramming involves the re-activation of pluripotency genes and the silencing of somatic ones, it remains unclear the role of Tet1 in the reprogramming process. Here, we performed hMeDIP-seq and RNA-seq during somatic cells reprogramming with Tet1 over expression to invest the effect of Tet1.

(Submitter supplied) Both immunodeficient and wild type NOD mice exhibit defects in control of early T-cell development in the thymus. We show that Rag1-deficient NOD mice fail to enforce both the b-selection checkpoint and an earlier T-cell commitment checkpoint, based on genome-wide genetic and transcriptome analyses. A major QTL peak for the checkpoint breakthrough phenotype mapped to the diabetes susceptibility Idd9/11 region, as confirmed by congenic mouse analysis. more...

3827. mRNA-seq in DNA methylation deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation and the Polycomb Repression System are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression. Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting. However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear. more...

3829. The histone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20 is required for MLL-rearranged leukemia
(Submitter supplied) MLL-fusions are potent oncogenes that initiate aggressive forms of acute leukemia. As aberrant transcriptional regulators, MLL-fusion proteins alter gene expression in hematopoietic cells through interactions with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Notably, interference with MLL-fusion cofactors like DOT1L is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this disease. Here we identify the histone H2B E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20 as an additional requirement for MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. more...

3859. MeCP2 binds to 5hmC enriched within active genes and accessible chromatin in the nervous system
(Submitter supplied) The high level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) present in neuronal genomes suggests  that mechanisms interpreting 5hmC in the central nervous system (CNS) may differ from those present  in embryonic stem cells. Here we present quantitative, genome-wide analysis of 5hmC, 5-  methylcytosine (5mC) and gene expression in differentiated CNS cell types in vivo. We report that  5hmC is enriched in active genes, and that surprisingly strong depletion of 5mC is observed over these  regions. more...

3860. Nurr1 maintains fiber integrity and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression in dopamine neurons
(Submitter supplied) Nurr1 (Nr4a2, nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2) is needed for the development of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and has been associated with Parkinson's disease. We used mice where the Nurr1 gene is ablated by tamoxifen treatment selectively in dopaminergic neurons. As a control, we used tamoxifen-treated mice where Nurr1 is not ablated. By laser microdissection of neurons selected by their TH1 (Th1l, TH1-like homolog) gene expression, we selected dopaminergic neurons for RNA extraction and high-throughput mRNA sequencing, in order to identify genes regulated by Nurr1. more...

3876. Candida albicans induces monocyte training via epigenetic programming through a dectin 1-dependent pathway
(Submitter supplied) Non-specific protective effects against reinfection have been described following infection with Candida albicans. Here we show that mice defective in functional T and B lymphocytes were protected against reinfection with C. albicans in a monocyte-dependent manner. C. albicans and beta glucans induced functional programming of monocytes, leading to enhanced cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. The training required the beta glucan receptor dectin 1 and the non-canonical Raf 1 pathway. Monocyte training by beta-glucans was mediated by epigenetic mechanisms through genome-wide changes in histone trimethylation at H3K4. Pathway analysis showed specific induction of epigenetic changes in genes of innate immunity. The functional programming of monocytes, reminiscent of similar properties of NK cells, has been termed “trained immunity” and may be employed for the design of improved vaccination strategies.

(Submitter supplied) TRIM28 (KAP1 - KRAB-associated protein 1) is critical for the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we reveal that an essential impact of this process is the protection of cellular gene expression in early embryos from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within these genetic invaders. In TRIM28-depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably those harboring bivalent promoters. more...

(Submitter supplied) We assessed whether human transcripts expressed in an aneuploid mouse that carries human chromosome 21 (HsChr21) are spliced in a human-specific or mouse-specific fashion. In almost all cases, human-specific alternative splicing is maintained in the mouse nucleus. Species-specific splicing therefore appears to be primarily directed by cis-acting elements, rather than changes in the levels or activities of trans-acting factors.

(Submitter supplied) An autochthonous model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) permitted the analysis of why immunotherapy is ineffective in this human disease. Despite finding that PDA-bearing mice had cancer cell-specific CD8+ T cells, the mice, like human PDA patients, did not respond to two immunological checkpoint antagonists that promote the function of T cells, α-CTLA-4 and α-PD-L1. Immune control of PDA growth was achieved, however, by depleting carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). more...

3901. Transcriptome-wide miR-155 binding map reveals widespread non-canonical microRNA targeting [CLIP-seq data]
(Submitter supplied) microRNAs (miRNAs) are essential components of gene regulation, but identification of miRNA targets remains a major challenge.  Most target prediction and discovery relies on perfect complementarity of the miRNA seed to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR).  However, it is unclear to what extent miRNAs target sites without seed matches.  Here, we performed a transcriptome-wide identification of the endogenous targets of a single miRNA—miR-155—in a genetically controlled manner. more...

3904. Mechanistic and structural insight into the functional dichotomy between interleukin-2 and interleukin-15
(Submitter supplied) Interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-2 possess distinct immunological functions despite both signaling through IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor γ-chain, γc, We find that in the IL-15/IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc quaternary complex structure, IL-15 heterodimerizes IL-2Rβ and γc identically to the IL-2/IL-2Rα/IL-2Rβ/γc complex, despite differing receptor-binding chemistries. IL-15Rα dramatically increases the affinity of IL-15 for IL-2Rβ, and this allostery is required for IL-15 trans-signaling versus IL-2 cis-signaling. more...

3906. Regulation of pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells through epigenetic-threshold modulation and mRNA pruning
(Submitter supplied) The core pluripotency factors (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog), the Myc network, and the chromatin-modifying complexes such as PRC2 ensure the pluripotency and self-renewal of ES cells (ESC). How these factors coordinate with one another remains poorly understood. We report that Utf1, a target of Oct4 and Sox2, is a new bivalent chromatin component that buffers poised states of bivalent genes. By limiting PRC2 loading and Histone 3 lysine-27 trimethylation, Utf1 sets proper activation thresholds for bivalent genes. more...

3934. A role for Fkbp6 and the chaperone machinery in piRNA amplification and transposon silencing
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic silencing of transposons by Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) constitutes an RNA-based genome defense mechanism. Piwi endonuclease action amplifies the piRNA pool by generating new piRNAs from target transcripts by a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we identified mouse Fkbp6 as a factor in this biogenesis pathway delivering piRNAs to the Piwi protein Miwi2. Mice lacking Fkbp6 derepress LINE1 (L1) retrotransposon and display reduced DNA methylation due to deficient nuclear accumulation of Miwi2. more...

Here we show that simulated body temperature cycles, but not peripheral oscillators, can control the rhythmic expression of Cold-Inducible RNA binding Protein (CIRP) in cultured fibroblasts. In turn, loss-of-function experiments indicate that CIRP is required for high amplitude circadian gene expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we use a novel technique for locating regions of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) throughout the transcriptome and present a profile of m6A sites in the mouse brain. Our use of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-seq (MeRIP-Seq) identifies thousands of RNAs which contain m6A sites. In addition, we find that regions of m6A formation are particularly enriched near stop codons, which might provide clues into the potential funciton of this highly prevalent RNA modificaiton.

(Submitter supplied) Klf1 (formerly known as Eklf) regulates the development of erythroid cells from bi-potent progenitor cells via the transcriptional activation of a diverse set of genes. Mice lacking Klf1 die in utero prior to E15 from severe anemia due to the inadequate expression of genes controlling hemoglobin production, cell membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, and the cell cycle and proliferation. We have recently described the full repertoire of Klf1 binding sites in vivo by performing Klf1 ChIP-seq in primary erythroid tissue (E14.5 fetal liver). more...

(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor EBF1 is essential for lineage specification in early B cell development. Here we demonstrate by conditional mutagenesis that EBF1 was required for B cell commitment, pro-B cell development and subsequent transition to pre-B cells. Later in B cell development, EBF1 was essential for the generation and maintenance of distinct mature B cell types. Marginal zone and B-1 B cells were lost, whereas follicular and germinal center B cells were reduced in the absence of EBF1. more...

4025. Isoform diversity and regulation in peripheral and central neurons revealed through RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) To fully understand cell type identity and function in the nervous system there is a need to understand neuronal gene expression at the level of isoform diversity. Here we applied Next Generation Sequencing of the transcriptome (RNA-Seq) to purified sensory neurons and cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) grown on an axonal growth permissive substrate.  The goal of the analysis was to uncover neuronal type specific isoforms as a prelude to understanding patterns of gene expression underlying their intrinsic growth abilities. more...

4026. Widespread regulated alternative splicing of single codons accelerates proteome evolution
(Submitter supplied) Thousands of human genes contain introns ending in NAGNAG motifs (N any nucleotide), where both NAGs can function as 3' splice sites, yielding isoforms differing by inclusion/exclusion of just three bases. However, the functional importance of NAGNAG alternative splicing is highly controversial. Using very deep RNA-Seq data from sixteen human and eight mouse tissues, we found that approximately half of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation and that regulated events have been selectively retained: alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was ten times as likely to be conserved between species as for non-tissue-specific events. more...

4028. The little elongation complex (LEC) regulates small nuclear RNA transcription
(Submitter supplied) The Eleven-nineteen Lysine-rich Leukemia (ELL)-containing Super Elongation Complex (SEC) containing P-TEFb is a key regulator in the expression of HOX genes in Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL)-based leukemia. We have identified an SEC-like complex in Drosophila, as well as a distinct ELL-containing complex that lacks P-TEFb and other components of SEC named the "little elongation complex" (LEC). LEC subunits are highly enriched at RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes and the loss of LEC results in decreased snRNA expression in both flies and mammals. more...

(Submitter supplied) Signaling mediates cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway exemplifies one sub-group of Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, which besides established functions in stress response, also contributes to developmental processes by an unknown mechanism 1-4. Here we show by genome-wide location analysis that JNK binds directly to a large set of active promoters during differentiation of stem cells to neurons. more...

4033. Gene expression profile of right ventricles from adult wild type and Ezh2-deficient hearts
(Submitter supplied) Adult-onset diseases can be associated with in utero events, but mechanisms for this remain unknown. The polycomb histone methyltransferase, Ezh2, stabilizes transcription by depositing repressive marks during development that persist into adulthood, but its function in postnatal organ homeostasis is unknown. We show that Ezh2 stabilizes cardiac gene expression and prevents cardiac pathology by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor Six1, which functions in cardiac progenitors but is stably silenced upon cardiac differentiation. more...

(Submitter supplied) The number of transcripts where allelic bias is dependent parent-of-origin was predicted at 100-200 until two recent studies applied RNA-Seq to brain regions from reciprocally crossed inbred mouse strains and identified over a thousand novel imprinted loci, including hundreds present in only males or females. Reanalysis revealed that the vast majority of these novel loci are explained by technical and biological variation of the approach, and are not genuine cases of general or sex-specific parent-of-origin allelic expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Polycomb group (PcG) proteins initiate the formation of repressed chromatin domains and regulate developmental gene expression.  A mammalian PcG protein, Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), triggers transcriptional repression by catalyzing the addition of methyl groups onto lysine-27 of histone H3 (H3K27me2/3)1.  This action facilitates the binding of other PcG proteins to histone H3 and compaction of chromatin. more...

Calorie restriction (CR), the consumption of fewer calories while maintaining adequate nutrition, mitigates sarcopenia and many other age-related diseases. To identify potential mechanisms by which CR preserves skeletal muscle integrity during aging, we used mRNA-Seq for deep characterization of gene regulation and mRNA abundance in skeletal muscle of old mice compared with old mice subjected to CR. more...

(Submitter supplied) Interferon-alpha is a major therapeutic agent for many diverse diseases.  However, the interferon-alpha mechanism of therapeutic action and associated side effects are not well understood. In particular, thyroiditis is a common unexplained complication.  We hypothesized that direct thyroid-toxic actions coupled with immune mechanisms play a major role in the thyroiditis etiology. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the actions of interferon-alpha on cultured thyrocytes in vitro, and in vivo by creating transgenic mice overexpressing interferon-alpha tissue specifically in thyrocytes. more...

4055. Control of Embryonic Stem Cell Lineage Commitment by Core Promoter Factor, TAF3 (RNA-Seq data)
(Submitter supplied) We report that TAF3, a TBP-associated core promoter factor, is highly enriched in ES cells. In addition to its role in the core promoter recognition complex TFIID, genome-wide binding studies reveal that TAF3 localizes to chromosomal regions bound by CTCF and cohesin. Enrichment for TAF3/CTCF/cohesin bound regions distinguishes TAF3-activated from TAF3-repressed genes. Our findings support a new role of TAF3 in mediating long-range chromatin regulatory interactions to safeguard the finely-balanced transcriptional programs that give rise to pluripotency.

By utilizing a conditional allele of GATA3, we investigated the impact of GATA3 expression on the mRNA expression patterns in several of these cell types.  Correlation of GATA3 binding with gene expression changes indicates that GATA3 regulates a large number of stage- and cell-specific genes involved in multiple signaling and transcriptional pathways critical for T cell differentiation and immune responses.

4060. TEAD4 regulated genes in differentiated C2C12 myoblasts
(Submitter supplied) The TEAD (1-4) transcription factors comprise the conserved TEA/ATTS DNA binding domain recognising the MCAT element in the promoters of muscle-specific genes. Despite extensive genetic analysis, the function of TEAD factors in muscle differentiation has proved elusive due to redundancy amongst the family members. Expression of the TEA/ATTS DNA binding domain that acts a dominant negative repressor of TEAD factors in C2C12 myoblasts inhibits their differentiation, while selective shRNA knockdown of TEAD4 results in abnormal differentiation characterised by the formation of shortened myotubes. more...

4063. Comparative Analysis of RNA-Seq Alignment Algorithms and the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM).
(Submitter supplied) A critical task in high throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data is discrete in nature; therefore with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. more...

This process was suggested to coincide with a global increase of repressive heterochromatin, which results in a reduction of transcriptional plasticity and potential. Here we report the dynamics of the transcriptome and an abundant heterochromatic histone modification, dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), during neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells. more...

Although ESCS was identified in humans decades ago and since then the causative genes have been elucidated, our understanding of the accompanying retinal degeneration is still poorly understood. Knockout of the Nrl transcription factor in mice produces a retina overpopulated with S-cone like photoreceptors along with absence of rod photoreceptors and recapitulates many of the phenotypic features seen in human ESCS patients. more...

(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) play important roles in silencing of genes and retroelements. However, a comprehensive comparison of genes and repetitive elements repressed by these pathways has not been reported. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), the genes up-regulated following deletion of the H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1 are distinct from those de-repressed in mESC deficient in the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, with the exception of a small number of primarily germline-specific genes. more...

Here, we analyzed transcription initiation and elongation through genome-wide localization of Pol II, General Transcription Factors (GTFs) and active chromatin in developing T-cells. We show that Pol II and GTFs are recruited to known, highly T-cell-specific enhancers. We extend this observation for the first time to many new putative enhancers, a majority of which are transcribed with or without polyadenylation. more...

Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to understand the global distribution of gene expression levels, and to be able to interpret it mechanistically and functionally. Here we use RNA sequencing of mouse Th2 cells, coupled with a range of other techniques, to show that all genes can be separated, based on their expression abundance, into two distinct groups: one group comprising of lowly expressed and putatively non-functional mRNAs, and the other of highly expressed mRNAs with active chromatin marks at their promoters. more...

Comparative measurements of RNA polymerase distribution over the genome’s primary transcription units in different cell states can identify the genes and steps in the transcription cycle that are regulated during such transitions. To identify the complete transcriptional profiles of RNA polymerases with high sensitivity and resolution, as well as the critical regulated steps upon which regulatory factors act, we used genome-wide, nuclear run-on (GRO-seq) to map the density and orientation of transcriptionally-engaged RNA polymerases in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). more...

4093. Mechanisms Establishing TLR4-Responsive Activation States of Inflammatory Response Genes (Illumina sequencing data)
(Submitter supplied) Precise control of the innate immune response is required for resistance to microbial infections and maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. Because this response involves coordinate regulation of hundreds of genes, it provides a powerful biological system to elucidate the molecular strategies that underlie signal- and time-dependent transitions of gene expression. Using a combination of genome-wide and gene-specific approaches, we provide evidence that rather than representing off/on transitions, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of nearly all immediate/early (I/E) and late response genes results from a sequential process in which signal-independent factors, exemplified by Gabpa, initially establish basal levels of gene expression that are then amplified by signal-dependent transcription factors. more...

4095. Role of Prdm14 in mouse embryonic stem cells: ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses
(Submitter supplied) Prdm14 is a PR-domain and zinc-finger protein whose expression is restricted to the pluripotent cells of an early embryo, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and germ cells. Here we show that Prdm14 safeguards mouse ESC maintenance by preventing induction of extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) fates. Conversely, Prdm14 overexpression impairs ExEn differentiation during embryoid body (EB) formation. Prdm14 occupies and represses genomic loci encoding ExEn differentiation factors, while also binding to and promoting expression of genes associated with ESC self-renewal. more...

Because <2% of sequences have protein-coding potential, why so much cellular energy is expended on RNA synthesis is a major question in the post-genomic era. The hypothesis that RNA may serve as recruiting platforms for chromatin modifiers has gained ground with discoveries linking long ncRNAs, such as RepA, Xist, and Tsix, to locus-specific targeting of Polycomb proteins to the X-chromosome. more...

Using BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors purified by a new technique, we demonstrate that glucocorticoids stimulate the earliest (BFU-E) progenitors to undergo limited self-renewal, which increases formation of CFU-E cells > 20-fold. more...

4099. Elucidating the stromal expression pattern in response to tumor-derived Shh
(Submitter supplied) Most tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract are known to depend on an excessive expression of Shh. It was recently discovered that this Shh does not signal on the tumor cells, but rather the stromal cells that in turn produce an unknown set of reciprocal signals that act as growth- or survival cues for the tumor cells. This sequencing effort aims to identify the reciprocal signals.

Here we propose a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Hundreds of single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. more...

(Submitter supplied) TDP-43, a DNA/RNA binding protein involved in RNA transcription and splicing has been associated with the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. However, the function of TDP-43 in motor neurons remains undefined. Here, we employ both gain- and loss-of-function approaches to determine roles of TDP-43 in motor neurons. Mice expressing human TDP-43 in neurons exhibited growth retardation and premature death that are characterized by abnormal intranuclear inclusions comprised of TDP-43 and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), and massive accumulation of mitochondria in TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons, lack of mitochondria in motor axon terminals and immature neuromuscular junctions. more...

We have performed a genome-wide characterization of imprinting in the mouse embryonic and adult brain using F1 hybrid mice generated from reciprocal crosses of CASTEiJ and C57BL/6J mice. We also uncovered genes associated with sex specific parental effects in the adult mouse brain. Our study identified preferential selection of the maternally inherited X chromosome in glutamatergic neurons of the female cortex.

Increasing insulin resistance in the mother maintains nutrient flow to the growing fetus, while prolactin and placental lactogen counterbalance this resistance and prevent maternal hyperglycemia by driving expansion of the maternal population of insulin-producing beta-cells. However, the exact mechanisms by which the lactogenic hormones drive beta-cell expansion remain uncertain. more...

4108. Diverse endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the mammalian transcriptome depend upon microRNAs, Drosha, and additional nucleases
(Submitter supplied) Messenger RNAs are regulated by a variety of degradation mechanisms in mammalian cells.  In the canonical animal microRNA pathway, microRNAs in complex with Argonaute proteins bind to many mRNA targets with imperfect complementarity, leading to degradation of the mRNA through the regular decay machinery.  The ancestral “slicer” endonuclease activity of Argonaute2 itself, which requires more extensive complementarity with the target RNA, is not used in this pathway, and has only been observed in two microRNA-guided cases. more...
