(Submitter supplied) Background: Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) remains one of the most debilitating neurological disorders and the majority of SCI patients are in the chronic phase. Previous studies of SCI that were limited by resources and technology have usually focused on few genes and pathways at a time. Thus, a comprehensive view of the complex molecular changes underlying SCI pathophysiology is needed. In particular, the biological roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of regulatory RNAs, have never been characterized systemically in SCI. more...

(Submitter supplied) The heart adapts to increased workload through hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes.  Although beneficial when induced physiologically by exercise, pathological cues including hypertension cause reexpression of fetal genes and dysfunctional hypertrophy, with lasting consequences for cardiac health. We hypothesised that these differences are driven by changes in chromatin-encoded cellular memory. We generated genome-wide maps of transcription and of two stable epigenetic marks, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, specifically in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, by selectively flow-sorting their nuclei. more...

36. Distinct Combinatorial Events Generated by ECM Degradation Dictate Cell Behavior
(Submitter supplied) It is well established that the expression profiles of multiple and possibly redundant matrix remodeling proteases (e.g. collagenases) strongly differ in health, disease and development. Although enzymatic redundancy might be inferred from their close similarity in structure, their in-vivo activity can lead to extremely diverse tissue-remodeling outcomes. We observed that proteolysis of collagen-rich natural extracellular matrix (ECM), generated uniquely by individual homologous proteases, leads to specific combinatorial events, which eventually affects overall ECM topography, visco-elastic properties and composition. more...

43. Signal-Dependent Recruitment of BRD4 to Cardiomyocyte Super-Enhancers is Suppressed by a MicroRNA [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) BRD4 governs pathological cardiac gene expression by binding acetylated chromatin, resulting in enhanced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation and transcription elongation. Here, we describe a signal-dependent mechanism for regulation of BRD4 in cardiomyocytes. BRD4 expression is suppressed by microRNA-9 (miR-9), which targets the 3’ untranslated region of the Brd4 transcript. In response to stress stimuli, miR-9 is downregulated, leading to derepression of BRD4 and enrichment of BRD4 at long-range super-enhancers (SEs) associated with pathological cardiac genes. more...

In order to explore the mechanism, we carried out high-throughtput sequencing (mRNA profile) to define downstream target of PIWIL during the process of neuronal migration. And we found the expression level of several microtubule-associated proteins decreased after downregulation of PIWIL1. Therefore, PIWIL1 plays an important role in neuronal migration by regulating the expression microtubule-associated proteins (such as Map1B, Map2, Tau) .

(Submitter supplied) Cardiac hypertrophy has been well-characterized at the level of transcription. During cardiac hypertrophy, genes normally expressed primarily during fetal heart development are re-expressed, and this fetal gene program is believed to be a critical component of the hypertrophic process. Recently, alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts has been shown to be temporally regulated during heart development, leading us to consider whether fetal patterns of splicing also reappear during hypertrophy.We hypothesized that patterns of alternative splicing occurring during heart development are recapitulated during cardiac hypertrophy. more...

173. Digital gene expression and global mapping of polyadenylation sites with PolyA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) We describe PolyA-Seq, a strand-specific method for high-throughput sequencing of the 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts. PolyA-Seq is as accurate for digital gene expression as existing RNA sequencing approaches, and superior to microarrays. We used the approach to map polyadenylation (polyA) sites in 24 samples from normal tissues in human, rhesus, dog, mouse, and rat.

174. Identification of Neuronal RNA Targets of TDP-43-Containing Ribonucleoprotein Complexes
(Submitter supplied) We identify the RNA targets of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) from cortical neurons by RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (RIP-seq). We identify 4352 highly enriched RNA targets of TDP-43. We determined that the canonical TDP-43 binding site (TG)n was 55.1-fold enriched in our TDP-43 library. Moreover, our analysis shows there is often an adenine in the middle of the motif, (TG)nTA(TG)m. more...

175. mRNA-seq with Agnostic Splice Site Discovery for CNS Transcriptomics Tested in Chronic Pain
(Submitter supplied) The study pursued dual goals: To advance mRNA-seq bioinformatics towards unbiased transcriptome capture and to demonstrate its potential for discovery in neuroscience by applying the approach to an in vivo model of neurological disease. We found that 12.4% of known genes were induced and 7% were suppressed in the dysfunctional (but anatomically intact) L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 2 weeks after L5 spinal Nerve Ligation (SNL). more...
