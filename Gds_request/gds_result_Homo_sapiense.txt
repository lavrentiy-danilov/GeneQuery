4. N6-methyladenosine Recruits HNRNPG for Alternative Splicing Regulation
(Submitter supplied) Understanding how RNA-binding proteins interact with RNA transcripts for splicing regulation is fundamental to human biology and disease. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), is important for RNA splicing, but its detailed mechanism remains unclear. We find the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (HNRNPG) selectively binds m6A-modified RNA in vitro and in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and androgen receptor (AR) is the major driver of the disease. Here we show that Enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 2 (ECI2) is a novel AR-target that promotes prostate cancer cell survival. Increased ECI2 expression predicts mortality in prostate cancer patients (p=0.0086). ECI2 encodes for an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, and we use multiple metabolite profiling platforms and RNA-seq to show that inhibition of ECI2 expression leads to decreased glucose utilization, accumulation of fatty acids and down-regulation of cell cycle related genes. more...

32. Altered regulation and expression of genes by BET family of proteins in alveolar macrophages from COPD patients
(Submitter supplied) BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRDT and BRD4) belong to the family of bromodomain containing proteins, which form a class of transcriptional co‑regulators.  BET proteins bind to acetylated lysines in the histones of nucleosomal chromatin and function either as co‑activators or co‑repressors of gene expression. An imbalance between HAT and HDAC activities resulting in hyperacetylation of histones has been identified in COPD.  We hypothesized that BET inhibitor (JQ1) treatment of BET protein interactions with hyperacetylated sites in the chromatin will regulate excessive activation of pro-inflammatory genes and survival of key inflammatory drivers, alveolar macrophages (AM) in COPD. more...

38. Genome-wide functional assessment of enhancer activities in the human genome
(Submitter supplied) We illustrate that modifications to the previously published STARR-seq protocols are capable of  assessing enhancer activity of  whole genomes on mammalian systems using the human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Besides detecting accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we are also able to discover active, inaccessible enhancers in closed chromatin regions. By applying histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, genes nearby the previously inaccessible enhancers are up-regulated, indicating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements. more...

41. Targeted Apoptosis of Senescent Cells Restores Tissue Homeostasis in Response to Chemotoxicity and Aging
(Submitter supplied) The accumulation of irreparable cellular damage restricts healthy lifespan after acute stress or natural aging. Senescent cells are thought to impair tissue function and their genetic clearance can successfully delay features of aging. Identifying how senescent cells avoid apoptosis would allow for the prospective design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether homeostasis can be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a pivot in the maintenance of senescent cell viability. more...

The role of H3K27M and reduced H3K27wt methylation in DIPG pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here, we have performed epigenomic profiling of patient-derived H3K27M mutant DIPG cells and demonstrate that H3K27M resides in nucleosomes with H3K27wt acetylation (H3K27ac), and H3K27M-H3K27ac containing nucleosomes co-localize with bromodomain proteins at actively transcribed genes and that PRC2 is excluded from H3K27M occupied regions. more...

71. Dynamics of HIV Latency and Reactivation in a Primary CD4+ T Cell Model
(Submitter supplied) HIV latency is a major obstacle to curing infection. Current strategies to eradicate HIV aim at increasing transcription of the latent provirus. In the present study we observed that latently infected CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected individuals failed to produce viral particles upon ex vivo exposure to SAHA (vorinostat), despite effective inhibition of histone deacetylases. To identify steps that were not susceptible to the action of SAHA or other latency reverting agents, we used a primary CD4+ T cell model, joint host and viral RNA sequencing, and a viral-encoded reporter. more...

(Submitter supplied) Alterations in distal regulatory elements that control gene expression underlie many diseases, including cancer. Epigenomic analyses of normal and diseased cells have produced correlative predictions for connections between dysregulated enhancers and target genes involved in pathogenesis. However, with few exceptions, these predicted cis-regulatory circuits remain untested. Here, we dissect cis-regulatory circuits that lead to overexpression of NEK6, a mitosis-associated kinase, in human B cell lymphoma. more...

78. The LIM protein AJUBA promotes colorectal cancer cell survival through suppression of JAK1/STAT1/IFIT2 network
(Submitter supplied) Background and Aims: The LIM protein AJUBA participates in the regulation of cell adhesion, mitosis, DNA damage, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and gene transcription, yet its roles in tumor development and progression are poorly defined. The aim is to determine the role of AJUBA in colorectal tumorigenesis. Methods:  We performed data mining in Oncomine databases and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays on 67 paired colorectal cancer (CRC) samples; we manipulated the AJUBA expression in SW-1116 and Caco-2 cells using specific shRNA and overexpression plasmids and performed assays for cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis; we performed RNA-seq and qRT-PCR assays to identify genes regulated by AJUBA; we performed western blot, co-immunoprecipitation assays to study the interaction of AJUBA and JAK/STAT; Results: We discovered that AJUBA is highly expressed in CRC and promotes CRC cell growth in culture and in xenograted mice via an inhibition of apoptosis by repression of the IFIT2 gene. more...

From yeast to mammals, TFIIIC binds to tRNA genes (tDNAs) and scattered “extra-TFIIIC” (ETC) loci and serves to tether these loci together as anchors of chromatin loops. more...

These subtypes carry important implications for prognosis and therapy. Interestingly, it is known that these different subtypes not only have different biological behaviors, but also have distinct gene expression profiles. However, it has not been rigorously explored whether particular transcriptional isoforms are also differentially expressed among breast cancer subtypes, or whether transcript isoforms from the same sets of genes can be used to differentiate subtypes. more...

We determined that oral cancer cells overexpressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) limited the cleavage of both caspase-3 and HuR, which in turn, reduced the rate of apoptosis in paclitaxel treated cells. Specific inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib promoted apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of HuR in paclitaxel-resistant oral cancer cells. more...

138. RNA sequencing of CACO-2 cells incubated with bifidobacteria grown on human milk oligosaccharides.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Breastfed human infants are predominantly colonized by bifidobacteria that thrive on human milk oligosaccharides (HMO).  The two most predominant species of bifidobacteria in infant feces are Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve) and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis), both avid HMO-consumer strains. Our laboratory has previously shown that B. infantis, when grown on HMO, increase adhesion to intestinal cells and increase the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. more...

175. Transcriptomic Profiling of 39 Neuroblastoma Cell Lines
(Submitter supplied) Neuroblastoma cell lines are an important and cost-effective model used to study oncogenic drivers of the disease. While many of these cell lines have been previously characterized with SNP, methylation, and/or expression microarrays, there has not been an effort to comprehensively sequence these cell lines. Here, we present raw whole transcriptome data generated by RNA sequencing of 39 commonly-used neuroblastoma cell lines. more...

183. The effect of PPARG inhibition on human angiomyolipoma cells
(Submitter supplied) Angiomyolipoma (AML), the most common benign renal tumor, can result in severe morbidity from hemorrhage and renal failure. While mTORC1 activation is involved in its growth, mTORC1 inhibitors fail to eradicate AML, highlighting the need for new therapies. Moreover, the identity of the AML cell of origin is obscure. AML research, however, is hampered by the lack of in-vivo models. Here, we establish a human AML-xenograft (Xn) model in mice, recapitulating AML at the histological and molecular levels. more...

184. Comprehensive analysis of gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: To identify the differences of gene expression between the macula and periphery of the eye. Methods: RNA Seq was performed on 8 normal postmortem eyes. Results: Significant differential expression was found between the layers of the posterior part of the eye and also between locations of a tissue layer. Conclusions: These results potentially provide a path to more rapidly elucidate not only the genetic basis of eye disease but also the impact of gene expression on molecular networks that in turn induce variations in disease associated traits.

236. Interrogation of functional cell surface markers identifies CD151 dependency in high-grade serous ovarian cancer
(Submitter supplied) The high degree of genetic aberrations characteristic of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) makes identification of the molecular features that drive tumor progression difficult. Here, we perform genome-wide RNAi screens and comprehensive expression analysis of cell surface markers in a panel of HGSC cell lines to identify genes that are critical to their survival. We report that the tetraspanin CD151 contributes to survival of a subset of HGSC cell lines associated with a ZEB transcriptional program and supports the growth of HGSC tumors. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA sequencing was performed on biological triplicates of LOUCY and PEER cells treated with 100nM GSK2879552 for 48h versus their corresponding DMSO treatment controls. GSK2879552 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of the lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1). Gene expression was severely affected by LSD1 inhibition.  Pathway analysis performed on the differentially expressed genes following 48hrs of LSD1i treatment clearly showed an increased apoptotic gene signature (CASP3, CASP8) and enhanced expression of genes associated with TRAIL signaling. more...

241. Transcriptome profiling of human keratoconus corneas through RNA sequencing identifies collagen synthesis disruption and downregulation of core elements of TGF-β, Hippo, and Wnt pathways
(Submitter supplied) To understand better the factors contributing to keratoconus (KTCN), we used RNA sequencing to perform a transcriptome profile of human KTCN corneas. Over 82% of the genes and almost 75% of the transcripts detected as differentially expressed in KTCN and non-KTCN corneas were confirmed in the replication study using another set of samples. We used these differentially expressed genes to generate a network of KTCN-deregulated genes. more...

242. RNA sequencing of primary human platelets and in vitro cell lines
(Submitter supplied) Platelets are anucleate cytoplasmic fragments that lack genomic DNA, but continue to synthesize protein using a pool of mRNAs, ribosomes, and regulatory small RNAs inherited from the precursor megakaryocyte (MK). The regulatory processes that shape the platelet transcriptome and the full scope of platelet translation have remained elusive. Using RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling of primary human platelets, we show the platelet transcriptome encompasses a subset of transcripts detected by RNA-Seq analysis of in vitro derived MK cells and these platelet-enriched transcripts are broadly occupied by ribosomes. more...

244. Potential of epigenetic therapy of acute myeloid leukemia using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and 3-deazaneplanocin-A
(Submitter supplied) Background:Aberrant DNA methylation that silences tumor suppressor genes occurs frequently in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment of AML patients with the inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR) can induce complete remissions, but most patients will relapse. The clinical efficacy of 5-AZA-CdR may be influenced by its limited capacity to activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by methylation of lysine 27 histone H3 (H3K27) by EZH2. more...

(Submitter supplied) Female human ESC-lines can carry active X-chromosomes (Xa) or an XIST-RNA-coated inactive X-chromosome (XiXIST+). Additionally, many ESC lines have abnormal X-chromosomeinactivation (XCI)-states where the Xi no longer expresses XIST-RNA and has transcriptionally active regions (eroded Xi=Xe). The fate of each XCI-state upon differentiation is unclear because individual lines often contain a mixture of XCI-states. more...

282. Systematic mapping of RNA-chromatin interactions in vivo
(Submitter supplied) RNA molecules can attach to chromatin and thus provide a type of epigenomic information. It remains difficult to know what RNAs are associated with chromatin and where are the genomic target loci of these RNAs. Here, we present MARGI (Mapping RNA-genome interactions), a technology to massively reveal native RNA-chromatin interactions from unperturbed cells. The gist of this technology is to ligate chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) with their target genomic sequence by proximity ligation, forming RNA-DNA chimeric sequences, which are converted to sequencing library for paired-end sequencing. more...

(Submitter supplied) The conditions of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia and nutrient starvation, play critical roles in cancer progression. However, the role of acidic extracellular pH in cancer progression is not studied as extensively as that of hypoxia. Here, we show that extracellular acidic pH (pH 6.8) triggered activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) by stimulating nuclear translocation and promoter binding to its targets along with intracellular acidification. more...

291. Adaptive chromatin remodeling in glioblastoma stem cell plasticity and drug tolerance
(Submitter supplied) Many cancers are postulated to harbor developmental hierarchies in which cells display variability in stem-like character, tumor propagating ability, and proliferation. In glioblastoma (GBM), glioma stem cells (GSCs) reside atop such a tumor cellular hierarchy, and are thought to resist current therapies and thus underlie inevitable relapse. Here we show that GSCs can evade RTK inhibition by reversibly regressing to a slow-cycling state reminiscent of quiescent neural stem cells. more...

Successful cDNA synthesis and amplification was confirmed as reads mapped primarily to exons. It has to be noted though, that a comparision of cell to cell data is not possible as coverage of the whole transcriptome was too low, approximately <1.0x coverage. Nonetheless, RNA-seq data provided first information of highly abundant transcripts in individual human spermatogonia. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Single-cell RNA-Seq can be a valuable and unbiased tool to dissect cellular heterogeneity, despite the transcriptome’s limitations in describing higher functional phenotypes and protein events. Perhaps the most important shortfall with transcriptomic ‘snapshots’ of cell populations is that they risk being descriptive, only cataloging heterogeneity at one point in time, and without microenvironmental context. more...

(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease of unknown etiology. A major limitation in transcriptomic profiling of lung tissue in IPF has been a dependence on snap-frozen fresh tissues (FF). In this project we sought to determine whether RNA-Seq could be used to identify IPF expression profiles from archived Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) lung fibrotic tissue. RESULTS: We isolated total RNA from 7 IPF and 5 control FFPE lung tissues (median archived time 6 years) and performed 50 bp paired-end sequencing on Illumina 2000 HiSeq. more...

Translocations of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene produce fusion proteins such as MLL-AF4 that disrupt epigenetic pathways and cause poor prognosis leukemias. Here we find that MLL-AF4 occupies a subset of unmethylated CG-enriched genes in combination with its cofactors Menin/LEDGF and ENL. more...

(Submitter supplied) We screened for small molecules that reactivated latent HIV-1 and identified benzotriazoles as latency-reducing agents. Here, we characterize the effects of HODHBt on gene expression in cultured T cells from three donors by polyA RNA-Seq and on STAT5A occupancy of the HIV-1 LTR promoter by ChIP-Seq. These and other results demonstrate that benzotriazoles block SUMOylation of phosphorylated STAT5, prolonging its transcriptional activity.

329. Gene expression profile of T-DM1 resistant and parental cell lines
(Submitter supplied) The esophageal cancer cell line OE-19 was used to select resistant cells to T-DM1. They were selected by prolonged exposure to increasing concentrations of T-DM1 in the absence or presence of ciclosporin A (CsA). Two cell lines resulted from these experimental conditions: OE-19 TR in the absence of CsA and OE-19 TCR in the presence of CsA. The parental cell line was named OE-19 S. The present study aims to detect the transcriptomic changes between OE-19 S, OE-19 TR and OE-19 TCR cell lines to identify the deregulated pathways involved in acquired resistance to T-DM1.

330. Rapid Recall Ability of Memory T cells is Encoded in their Epigenome
(Submitter supplied) Even though T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation together with co-stimulation is sufficient for the activation of both naïve and memory T cells, the memory cells are capable of producing lineage specific cytokines much more rapidly than the naïve cells. The mechanisms behind this rapid recall response of the memory cells are still not completely understood. Here, we performed epigenetic profiling of human resting naïve, central and effector memory T cells using ChIP-Seq and found that unlike the naïve cells, the regulatory elements of the cytokine genes in the memory T cells are marked by activating histone modifications even in the resting state. more...

351. Long noncoding RNAs transcribed by ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon act in cis to modulate long-range LTR enhancer function [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) LTR retrotransposons are repetitive DNA elements comprising ~10% of the human genome. However, Whether or how the LTR lncRNAs serve biological functions is largely unknown. Here we show that in primary human erythroblasts, lncRNAs transcribed from the LTR retrotransposons of ERV-9 human endogenous retrovirus regulated transcription of key erythroid genes. Global knock-down of ERV-LTR lncRNAs was performed in the in vitro erythropoiesis system of human CD34 cells, and genome wide RNA-seq was carried out to detect the effect on transcription.

(Submitter supplied) MyoD is known to transdifferentiate fibroblasts into muscle-like cells. Despite phenotypic resemblance and expression of myogenic marker genes in transdifferentiated cells, our global gene expression data suggests that ~100 genes, many involved in muscle development and function, remain non-reprogrammed. To understand this incomplete reprogramming, we characterized genome-wide chromatin accessibility and MyoD binding in human primary myoblasts and in MyoD-induced skin fibroblast cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Methyl-dependent regulation of transcription has expanded from a traditional focus on histones to encompass transcription factor modulation. While the Set7 lysine methyltransferase is associated with pro-inflammatory gene expression in vascular endothelial cells, genome-wide regulatory roles remain to be investigated. From initial characterization of Set7 as specific for methyl-lysine 4 of H3 histones (H3K4m1), biochemical activity toward non-histone substrates has revealed additional mechanisms of gene regulation. more...

357. Therapeutic targeting MLL degradation pathways in MLL-rearranged leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Chromosomal translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with various partner genes result in aggressive leukemia with dismal outcomes. Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. more...

358. MYC Mediates mRNA Cap Methylation of Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin Signaling Transcripts by Recruiting CDK7 and RNA Methyltransferase
(Submitter supplied) We performed an RNA pulldown against a methyl group on the mRNA cap using a fusion protein, GST-eIF4E, highly specific for a m7G-mRNA cap. We performed RNA-seq on both the pulldowns and inputs and normalized our pulldown to input in order to determine which genes MYC targets for mRNA cap methylation above and beyond any affect at the transcriptional level. We found that MYC targets approximately 30% of transcripts for enhanced mRNA cap methylation above 1.2 fold on a global scale following 24 h of MYC induction, specifically transcripts involved in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. more...

361. The novel lysine specific methyltransferase METTL21B affects mRNA translation through inducible and dynamic methylation of Lys-165 in human eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A)
(Submitter supplied) Lysine methylation is abundant on histone proteins, representing a dynamic regulator of chromatin state and gene activity, but is also frequent on many nonhistone proteins, including eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A). However, the functional significance of eEF1Amethylation remains obscure and it has remained unclear whether eEF1A methylation is dynamic and subject to active regulation. We here demonstrate, using a wide range of in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the previously uncharacterized human methyltransferase METTL21B specifically targets Lys-165 in eEF1A in an aminoacyl-tRNA- and GTP-dependent manner. more...

384. Nuclear Surveillance of long intervening noncoding RNA
(Submitter supplied) Numerous long intervening non-coding RNA (lincRNA) are generated from the mammalian genome by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription.  Although multiple functions have been ascribed to lincRNA, their synthesis and turnover remain poorly characterised. Here we define systematic differences in transcription and RNA processing between protein-coding and lincRNA genes in human HeLa cells. This is based on a range of nascent transcriptomic approaches applied to different nuclear fractions, including mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). more...

391. TRIM28 controls a gene regulatory network based on endogenous retroviruses in human neural progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which make up 8% of the human genome, have been proposed to participate in the control of gene regulatory networks. In this study, we find a region- and developmental stage-specific expression pattern of ERVs in the developing human brain, which is linked to a transcriptional network based on ERVs. We demonstrate that almost ten thousand, primarily primate-specific ERVs, act as docking platforms for the epigenetic co-repressor protein TRIM28 in human neural progenitor cells, which results in the establishment of local heterochromatin. more...

400. Identifying markers predicting successful graft outcome for clinical translation of hESC-based cell therapy for Parkinson’s disease
(Submitter supplied) Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are expected to reach clinical  trials soon. Most of the approaches currently under development involve  transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and  functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long term graft outcome already at the  progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify  predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft  outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis  of >30 batches of grafted hESC-derived progenitors. more...

403. LARP4B is an mRNA stability factor that acts via AU-rich sequence elements
(Submitter supplied) mRNAs are key molecules in gene expression and subject to diverse regulatory events. Regulation is accomplished by distinct sets of trans-acting factors that interact with mRNAs and form defined mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs). The resulting “mRNP code” determines the fate of any given mRNA and thus determines the gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. The La-related protein 4B (LARP4B) belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA binding factors characterized by the presence of a La-module implicated in direct RNA binding. more...

422. Harnessing RNA sequencing for global, unbiased evaluation of two new adjuvants for dendritic-cell immunotherapy
(Submitter supplied) Effective stimulation of immune cells is crucial for the success of cancer immunotherapies. Current approaches to evaluate the efficiency of stimuli activating immune cells are mainly defined by known flow cytometry-based cell activation or cell maturation markers. This method however does not give a complete overview of the achieved activation state and may leave important side effects unnoticed. Here, we used an unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach to compare the capacity of four clinical-grade dendritic cell (DC) activation stimuli used to prepare DC-vaccines composed of various types of DC subsets; the already clinically applied GM-CSF and Frühsommer meningoencephalitis (FSME) prophylactic vaccine and the novel clinical grade adjuvants protamine-RNA (pRNA) complexes and CpG-P. more...

447. Reversible methylation of m6Am in the 5′ cap controls mRNA stability
(Submitter supplied) Internal bases in mRNA can be subjected to modifications that influence the fate of mRNA in cells. One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5′ end of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap. Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. more...

448. MRTF activates TEAD-YAP target gene expression
(Submitter supplied) Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and Myocardin Related Transcription Factor (MRTF) play similar roles and crosstalk in directing the transcriptional responses to chemical and physical extracellular cues. However the mechanism by which the two proteins crosstalk has been unclear. Here, we show MRTF family proteins bind YAP via a conserved PPXY motif that interacts with the YAP WW domain. This interaction allows MRTF to recruit NcoA3 to the TEAD-YAP transcriptional complex and potentiate its transcriptional activity. more...

484. Integrated analyses identify phenotype specific BMP4 signaling in breast cancer [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis. In breast cancer, it reduces proliferation and increases migration in a cell line-dependent manner. To characterize the transcriptional mediators of these phenotypes, we performed RNA-seq and DNase-seq analyses after BMP4 treatment in MDA-MB-231 and T-47D breast cancer cells that respond to BMP4 with enhanced migration and decreased cell growth, respectively.

498. RPA interacts with HIRA and regulates H3.3 deposition at gene regulatory elements in mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) The incorporation of histone variant H3.3 has been implicated in the formation and maintenance of specialized chromatin structure in metazoan cells. H3.3 is enriched in promoters, regulatory elements and genebody, and HIRA is required for H3.3 enrichment in these regions. But the mechanism of regulating H3.3 deposition by HIRA remains elusive. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators, we identify single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA as being critically required for deposition of newly synthesized H3.3. more...

558. Selective reactivation of human X-linked genes in female fibroblasts reprogrammed by cell fusion
(Submitter supplied) In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes is silenced as pluripotent cells differentiate. This process, termed X-inactivation, is random and results in mosaic expression of many X-linked genes in female tissues. Although X-inactivation can be reversed in vitro by reprogramming, the extent varies according to species, operator and conditions. Here, we have reprogrammed cloned female human fibroblasts by fusing them with mouse ESCs and examined the kinetics of X-linked gene re-expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC1/C2) functions as an RNA splicing regulator through co-transcriptional association with nascent mRNA. HnRNPC1/C2 can also bind to double-stranded DNA as a vitamin D response element-binding protein (VDRE-BP), thereby regulating transcriptional activity of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) bound to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). In this way hnRNPC1/C2 may act as a coupling factor for 1,25(OH)2D-directed transcription and RNA splicing. more...

(Submitter supplied) In this work, we generated early human amnion-like tissues by culturing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a bioengineered implantation-like niche in vitro. To explore the gene expression profile of hPSC-derived amnion-like cells (hPSC-amnion), we performed mRNA-sequencing for both undifferentiated hPSCs and hPSC-amnion. Here we show that hPSC-amnion differs from hPSCs by actively regulating a comprehensive set of transcriptional regulation network and developmental signaling pathways such as BMP-SMAD signaling.

(Submitter supplied) A massively expanded outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) in the primate and human has been proposed for generating majority of neocortical neurons, which consists of basally located radial glia cells. Previous studies with various strategies have tried to recognize genes specifically expressed in those cells; however, the molecular and cellular features of these cells still remain uncertain.  By profiling gene expression across single cells isolated from cellular anatomy location and subtype sorting, we identified a primate-specific gene TMEM14B as a novel marker for basally located radial glia. more...

(Submitter supplied) Survival rates for children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have drastically improved, but those carrying mutations in the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene continue to have a very poor prognosis. The most common MLL mutation in ALL is the t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosome translocation that fuses MLL in frame with the AF4 gene producing MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL fusion proteins. Previously, we showed that MLL-AF4 binds to the BCL-2 gene and directly activates it through DOT1L recruitment and increased H3K79me2/3 levels. more...

(Submitter supplied) Gene regulatory networks are pivotal for many biological processes. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) the transcriptional network can be divided into three functionally distinct modules: Polycomb, Core and Myc. The Polycomb module represses developmental genes, while the Myc module is associated with proliferative functions and its mis-regulation is linked to cancer development. Here, we show that in mESCs the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) associated protein EPOP (a.k.a C17orf96, esPRC2p48, E130012A19Rik) co-localizes at chromatin with members of the Myc and Polycomb module. more...

642. Nucleoporin-mediated regulation of cell identity genes
(Submitter supplied) The organization of the genome in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus is coupled with cell type-specific gene expression. However, how nuclear architecture influences transcription that governs cell identity remains unknown. Here, we show that Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) components Nup93 and Nup153 bind super-enhancers (SE), regulatory structures that drive the expression of key genes that specify cell identity. more...

(Submitter supplied) Whereas cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) represent the most promising therapeutic avenue in cancer immunotherapy, adaptive transfer of antigen-specific CTLs has faced difficulty in efficient expansion of CTLs from patients in ex vivo culture. To solve this issue, several groups have proposed that the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology can be applied for the expansion of antigen-specific CTLs: when iPSCs are produced from antigen-specific CTLs and CTLs are induced from these iPSCs, all regenerated CTLs express the same TCR as original CTLs. more...

989. Tristetraprolin disables prostate cancer maintenance by impairing proliferation and metabolic function
(Submitter supplied) Tristetraprolin (TTP) is an RNA-binding protein that post-transcriptionally suppresses gene expression by delivering mRNA cargo to processing bodies (P-bodies) where the mRNA is degraded. TTP functions as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma, and in some human malignancies low TTP expression correlates with reduced survival. Here we report important prognostic and functional roles for TTP in human prostate cancer. more...

1364. Gene expression profile of wt-, S473A- and S473D-KAP1-re-expression in KAP1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell
(Submitter supplied) We study the gene regulation function of serine 473 phosphorylation of KAP1 (pS473-KAP1) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Wild type KAP1, S473A-KAP1 (phospho-acceptor site mutant) and S473D-KAP1 (phospho-mimetic mutant) are re-expressed in KAP1 knockdown cells. We analyze the gene expression profile in these three cells and find that many mitochondrial complex genes are up-regulated in S473D-KAP1 re-expressing cells. more...

1366. Laminin-guided highly efficient endothelial commitment from human pluripotent stem cells [Single Cell RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Obtaining highly purified differentiated cells via directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an essential step for the clinical application of hPSCs. Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified (>95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

1374. Integrative classification of human coding and non-coding genes based on RNA metabolism profiles
(Submitter supplied) The pervasive transcription of the human genome results in a heterogeneous mix of coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Only a small fraction of lncRNAs possess demonstrated regulatory functions, making it difficult to distinguish functional lncRNAs from non-functional transcriptional byproducts. This has resulted in numerous competing incoherent annotations of human lncRNA. To address these challenges, we quantitatively examined transcription, splicing, degradation, localization and translation for coding and non-coding human genes. more...

1383. Macrophages redirect phagocytosis by non-professional phagocytes and influence inflammation
(Submitter supplied) Professional phagocytes (such as macrophages) and non-professional phagocytes (such as epithelial cells) clear billions of apoptotic cells and particles on a daily basis. Since these phagocytes reside in proximity in most tissues, whether cross-communication exists between them during cell clearance, and how this might impact inflammation are not known. Here, we show that macrophages, via the release of a soluble growth factor and microvesicles, redirect the type of particles engulfed by non-professional phagocytes and influence their inflammatory response. more...

We apply an epigenomic approach to characterize the molecular events involved in fumarate or BG induced trained innate immunity. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data were generated. This analysis identified epigenetic programs in trained macrophages, with fumarate exposure inducing a small subset of BG-induced histone acetylation and methylation changes.

1416. Large-scale epigenetic reprogramming is punctuated late during the evolution of pancreatic cancer progression [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) During pancreatic cancer progression, heterogeneous subclonal populations evolve in the primary tumor that possess differing capacities to metastasize and cause patient death. However, the genetics of metastasis reflects that of the primary tumor, and PDAC driver mutations arise early. This raises the possibility than an epigenetic process could be operative late. Using an exceptional resource of paired patient samples, we found that different metastatic subclones from the same patient possessed remarkably divergent malignant properties and global epigenetic programs. more...

Such methods can cause loss of coverage at the 5’ end of genes, impacting the ability to detect fusions when used on degraded samples. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected mRNA and to identify the variables involved in this process Methods: Total RNA was extracted from solid tumor tissue and whole blood using the Qiagen® miRNeasy Micro and Mini kits, respectively. more...

1434. OmoMYC blunts promoter invasion by oncogenic MYC to inhibit gene expression characteristic of MYC-dependent tumors
(Submitter supplied) MYC genes have both essential roles during normal development and exert oncogenic functions during tumorigenesis. Expression of a dominant-negative allele of MYC, termed OmoMYC, can induce rapid tumor regression in mouse models with little toxicity for normal tissues. How OmoMYC discriminates between physiological and oncogenic functions of MYC is unclear. We have solved the crystal structure of OmoMYC and show that it forms a stable homodimer and as such recognizes DNA in the same manner as the MYC/MAX heterodimer. more...

1437. naive T cell heterogeneity after neonatal thymectomy
(Submitter supplied) The generation of new naive T-cells is dependent on thymic output, but in adults the naive T-cell pool is primarily maintained by peripheral proliferation. Naive T-cells have long been regarded as relatively quiescent cells but recently it was shown that IL-8 production is a signatory effector function of naïve T-cells, at least in newborns. With human aging naïve CD4 T-cell numbers decline but it is not clear whether this is accompanied by (functional) differentiation of naïve T-cells and loss of true naivety. more...

1438. RNA-seq analyses of JMJD3c-overexpressing human embryonic stem cells
(Submitter supplied) We generated the human ES line, in which the genome-wide reduction of H3K27me3 can be induced by the ectopic expression of catalytic domain of histone demethylase JMJD3 with doxycycline treatment (JMJD3c-hESCs). The forced-demethylation of H3K27me3 triggered the upregulation of many developmental genes. Overexpression of JMJD3c mutant, which lacked catalytic activity, did not induce these changes. These results suggest that H3K27me3 demethylase activity of JMJD3 is necessary and sufficient for upregulation of developmental genes in hESCs.

(Submitter supplied) Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a central component of protein synthesis and cell signaling network. One salient feature of tRNA is its heavily modified status, which can critically impact its function. Here we show that mammalian ALKBH1 is a tRNA demethylase. It mediates the demethylation of N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in tRNAs. The ALKBH1-catalyzed demethylation of the target tRNAs results in their reduced partition in polysomes and their decreased usage in protein synthesis. more...

1474. ZMYND8 co-localizes with NuRD on target genes and regulates recruitment of GATAD2A/NuRD to sites of DNA damage [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The NuRD complex is generally thought to repress transcription at both hyper- and hypomethylated regions in the genome. In addition, the complex is involved in the DNA damage response. Here, we show that ZMYND8 bridges NuRD to a number of putative DNA-binding zinc finger proteins. The ZMYND8 MYND domain directly interacts with PPPL? motifs in the NuRD subunit GATAD2A. Furthermore, GATAD2A and GATAD2B exclusively form homodimers and they thus define mutually exclusive NuRD subcomplexes. more...

The role of the H3.3K36M mutation in tumorigenesis of this typically benign bone tumor with high recurrence rates is unknown. Here, we show that H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (me2 and me3) levels are reduced globally in chondroblastomas, as well as in chondrocytes stably expressing the H3.3K36M mutation because the H3.3M36 mutation protein inhibits the activity of lysine methyl transferases, MMSET and SetD2. more...

1501. Transcriptome changes due to nuclear penetration of cancer extracellular vesicles
(Submitter supplied) Extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) function as vehicles of intercellular communication in autocrine or paracrine manner. We report that cancer-derived EV biomaterials reach nuclei of human melanoma and breast carcinoma cells and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  (MSCs) through Rab7+ late endosome subdomains that penetrate into nuclear envelope invaginations. MSCs were exposed to cancer Evs in the presence or absence of drugs that block nucler import or export through the nuclear pores. more...

1504. Whole transcriptome splicing analysis in isogenic lung epithelial and adenocarcinoma cell lines with or without a recurrent splicing factor mutation, U2AF1 (S34F)
(Submitter supplied) The splicing factor gene, U2AF1, is recurrently mutated in a variety of human cancers, including lung adenocarcinomas.  The most frequent U2AF1 mutant, U2AF1 p.Ser34Phe (S34F), induces specific changes in pre-mRNA splicing, but it is unclear how these splicing changes are regulated. We have used genomic editing methods to modify the U2AF1 gene locus in an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC3kt) and in human lung adenocarcinoma cells with pre-existing U2AF1 alleles, creating a U2AF1 S34F allele in the endogenous locus of HBEC3kts and inactivating U2AF1 S34F alleles in two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H441 and HCC78). more...

Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. more...

1534. BCL6-centric reorganization of the genome during B cell affinity maturation
(Submitter supplied) During the humoral immune response mature B-cells undergo a dramatic change in phenotype to enable antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs).  Here, we observe for the first time that these phenotypic changes are accompanied by large-scale reorganization of the genomic architecture that encodes the GCB-cell transcriptional program.  The coordinate expression of genes that specify the GCB-cell phenotype – most prominently, BCL6 – is achieved through a non-random, multilayered, chromatin reorganization process involving i) increased promoter connectivity, ii) formation of higher-order enhancer networks, iii) 5’ to 3’ gene looping, and iv) merging of gene neighborhoods that share active epigenetic marks. more...

1568. DMS-MaPseq: A genome-wide or targeted approach for RNA structure probing in vivo
(Submitter supplied) Here we present dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq), which encodes DMS modifications as mismatches using a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase (TGIRT). DMS-MaPseq yields a high signal-to-noise ratio, can report multiple structural features for each molecule, and allows genome-wide studies as well as focused investigations of low abundance RNAs. We apply DMS-MaPseq to Drosophila melanogaster ovaries—the first experimental analysis of RNA structure in an animal tissue—and demonstrate its utility in the discovery of a functional RNA structure involved in the non-canonical GUG translation initiation of the human FXR2 mRNA. more...

These cells are characterized by the coexpression of SIX2 and CITED1. Many studies on mouse models as well as on human pluripotent stem cells have advanced our knowledge of NPs, but very little is known about this population in humans, since it is exhausted before birth and strategies for its direct isolation are still limited. more...

1570. Acetylation-Dependent Control of Global Poly(A) RNA Degradation by CBP/p300 and HDAC1/2
(Submitter supplied) Acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases regulate gene expression at the level of chromatin, mainly by affecting transcription. In this study, we report that hyperacetylation induced by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) causes massive degradation of mRNA. The effect is promoter-independent and affects poly-A mRNA globally. HDAC inhibition leads to the removal of poly-A tails from mRNAs through activation of the deadenylase CAF1a, which we find to be acetylated together with its activator BTG2 by the histone acetyl transferases (HATs) p300 and CBP. more...

1573. Loss of HDAC-mediated repression and gain of NF-kB activation underlies cytokine induction in ARID1A and PIK3CA mutation-driven ovarian cancer
(Submitter supplied) ARID1A is frequently mutated in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma (OCCC) and often co-exists with activating mutations of PIK3CA. Although induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been observed in this cancer, the mechanism by which the two mutations synergistically activate cytokine genes remains elusive. Here we established an in vitro model of OCCC by introducing ARID1A knock-down and mutant PIK3CA in a normal human ovarian epithelial cell line, which resulted in cell transformation and cytokine gene induction. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transition from castration resistant prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is emerging as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. NEPC are associated with over-expression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). N-Myc is a bona fide driver oncogene in several rare tumor types, but its role in prostate cancer progression is not well established.  Integrating a novel genetically engineered mouse model and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we show that N-Myc over-expression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC tumors which includes an abrogation of AR signaling and induction of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 signaling and that N-Myc interacts with AR and this interaction depends on Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2. more...

1604. Using AmpliSeq we have performed quantitative analysis of 20,803 genes in Negative control precursor-miR (NC-Pre-miR) and pre-miR-17 transfected Rheumatoid arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts (RASFs)
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: The goals of this study are to determine the effect of microRNA-17 overexpression on 20,803 human genes in RASFs using Ion ProtonTM System platform. Human RASFs from two RA patients were transfected with pre-miR-17 or NC-pre-miR for 48 h and total RNA was prepared using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA integrity was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bio analyzer (Santa Clara, CA). 10 ng of high quality RNA was used to make cDNA for amplification with the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).  The cDNA was subjected to 12 cycles of amplification with panel primers and barcoded with adapters as recommended.  Resulting sequencing libraries were quantified by qPCR using SYBR FAST master mix from KapaBiosystems (Wilmington, MA).  Sets of eight libraries were balanced, pooled and sequencing beads produced on an Ion Chef.  Sequencing was performed on an Ion P1 semi-conductor sequencing chip using an Ion Proton™ System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). Data was collected and primary analysis performed using Torrent Suite software version 5.0.3. Reads were mapped to the panel and expression values determined. R Software version R-3.2.3 was used to generate heatmap. Among the panel of 20,803 genes, the expression of 15,067 genes as shown in the representative heat map was observed in pre-miR-17 and NC-pre-miR transfected RASFs. A total of 664 significantly modulated genes (301 upregulated and 363 downregulated) using Student ‘t’ test were further utilized for the IPA analysis. The result of IPA predicted the protein ubiquitin pathway as a major canonical pathway affected by the differentially regulated genes. Interestingly, IPA analysis generated an interactome that showed connectivity among various ubiquitin ligases, NF-ԟB family, AP-1/cJun, 20S and 26S proteasome system. Conclusion: Our results clearly shows the major pathways affected by miR-17 overexpression in RASFs were Protein ubiquitination related.

1632. Analyzing the interactions of mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs to predict competing endogenous RNA networks in glioblastoma
(Submitter supplied) Cross-talk between competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) may play a critical role in revealing potential mechanisms of tumor development and physiology. Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor, and the mechanisms of tumor genesis and development in glioblastoma are unclear. Here, to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs and the ceRNA network in glioblastoma, we performed paired-end RNA sequencing and microarray analyses to obtain the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs circRNAs and miRNAs. more...

1635. TUT7 Catalyzes the Uridylation of the 3’ End for Rapid Degradation of Histone mRNA
(Submitter supplied) Using high-throughput sequencing of histone mRNAs and degradation intermediates, we find that knockdown of TUT7 reduces both the uridylation at the 3’ end as well as uridylation pattern at the 3’ end, and only had a small effect on the uridylation in the stemloop uridylation of the major during histone mRNA degradation. Knockdown of 3’ hEXO also altered the uridylation of histone mRNAs, revealing a dynamic equilibrium between 3’ hEXO digestion and TUT7 uridylation, suggesting that TUT7 and 3’ hExo function together in trimming and uridylating histone mRNAs.

1665. Targeting Chromatin Regulators Inhibits Leukemogenic Gene Expression in NPM1 Mutant Leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Homeobox (HOX) proteins and the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are frequently highly expressed and mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant HOX expression is found in nearly all AMLs that harbor a mutation in the Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene, and FLT3 is concomitantly mutated in approximately 60% of these cases. Little is known how mutant NPM1 (NPM1mut) cells maintain aberrant gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that the histone modifiers MLL1 and DOT1L control HOX and FLT3 expression and differentiation in NPM1mut AML. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing domain screen, we show NPM1mut AML to be exceptionally dependent on the menin binding site in MLL1. Pharmacological small-molecule inhibition of the menin-MLL protein interaction had profound anti-leukemic activity in human and murine models of NPM1mut AML in vitro and in vivo. Combined pharmacological inhibition of menin-MLL and DOT1L resulted in dramatic suppression of HOX and FLT3 expression, induction of differentiation, and superior activity against NPM1mut leukemia. Together, MLL1 and DOT1L are chromatin regulators that control HOX, MEIS1 and FLT3 expression and are therapeutic targets in NPM1mut AML. Combinatorial small-molecule inhibition has synergistic on target activity and constitutes a novel therapeutic concept for this common AML subtype.

1666. Reprogramming by de-bookmarking somatic transcriptional program via targeting the BET bromodomains
(Submitter supplied) One critical task in pluripotent reprogramming is to erase the somatic transcriptional program of starting cells.  No strategy or theory exists for achieving erasure of somatic gene expression memory.  Here, we present a proof-of-principle strategy in which reprogramming to pluripotency is facilitated by small molecules that erase somatic cell transcription memory.  We show that mild chemical targeting of the acetyllysine-binding pockets of the BET bromodomains, the transcriptional bookmarking domains, robustly enhances reprogramming. more...

1667. Recurrent somatic mutations in POLR2A define a distinct subset of meningiomas [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) RNA polymerase II mediates the transcription of all protein-coding genes in eukaryotic cells, a process that is fundamental to life. Genomic mutations in this enzyme have not been previously linked to any pathology in humans, a testament to its indispensable role in cell biology. Based on a combination of next-generation genomic analyses of 775 meningiomas, we report that recurrent somatic p.Gln403Lys or p.Leu438_His439del mutations in POLR2A, which encodes the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II, are sufficient to hijack this essential enzyme and drive neoplasia. more...

1669. Potent and targeted activation of HIV-1 using the CRISPR/Cas9 activator Complex
(Submitter supplied) Integration of the HIV-1 provirus in the host genome ensures a persistent supply of latently infected cells. This latent reservoir is recalcitrant to antiretroviral therapy (ART) making lifelong treatment the only option for patients. The “shock and kill” strategy aims to eradicate latent HIV by reactivating proviral gene expression followed by ART treatment. Gene specific transcriptional activation can be achieved using the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system comprising small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with a nuclease deficient Cas9 mutant (dCas9) fused to the VP64 transactivation domain (dCas9-VP64). more...

1672. An integrative transcriptomics approach identifies miR-503 as a candidate master regulator of the estrogen response [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is an important biomarker of breast cancer severity and a common therapeutic target. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its role in promoting proliferation, ERα also protects tumors against metastatic transformation. Current therapeutics antagonize ERα and interfere with both beneficial and detrimental signaling pathways stimulated by ERα. The goal of this study is to uncover the dynamics of coding and non-coding RNA (microRNA) expression in response to estrogen stimulation and identify potential therapeutic targets that more specifically inhibit ERα-stimulated growth and survival pathways without interfering with its protective features. more...

1699. Global gene expression profiles of cardiac progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture under simulated microgravity
(Submitter supplied) Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes, 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth, development, and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity.

(Submitter supplied) The telomerase RNA component (TERC) is a critical determinant of cellular self renewal. Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required for post-transcriptional maturation of TERC. PARN mutations lead to incomplete 3′ end processing and increased destruction of nascent TERC RNA transcripts, resulting in telomerase deficiency and telomere diseases. Here, we determined that overexpression of TERC increased telomere length in PARN-deficient cells and hypothesized that decreasing post-transcriptional 3′ oligo-adenylation of TERC would counteract the deleterious effects of PARN mutations. more...

To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%–99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. more...

1733. RNA-seq analysis of add-back rescued TALEN-mediated LATS2 knockout HeLa-S3 cells
(Submitter supplied) Chromatin modifying activities for construction of appropriate epigenetic landscapes by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play an essential role in development and tumorigenesis. However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. more...

To better understand the tissue-specific expression characteristics of transcripts in different human tissues, we deeply sequenced RNA samples from 14 different human tissues. After filtering many lowly expressed transcripts, 24,729 protein-coding transcripts and 1,653 noncoding transcripts were identified. By analyzing highly expressed tissue-specific protein-coding transcripts (TSCTs) and noncoding transcripts (TSNTs), we found that testis expressed the highest numbers of TSCTs and TSNTs. more...

1751. EZH2 and BCL6 cooperate to assemble CBX8-BCOR Polycomb complex to repress bivalent promoters, mediate germinal center formation and promote lymphomagenesis [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) EZH2 mediates the humoral immune response and drives lymphomagenesis through de novo formation of bivalent chromatin domains and critical germinal center (GC) B cell promoters.  We show that such formation is dependent on the presense of BCL6 and the presence of non-canonical PRC1-BCOR complex.  We observe that BCL6 and EZH2 cooperate to accelerate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development and combinatorial targeting of these repressors results in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in vitro, in vivo, and in primary human DLBCLs.

(Submitter supplied) There is great medical need for estrogens having favorable pharmacological profiles, supporting desirable activities for menopausal women such as metabolic and vascular protection but lacking stimulatory activities on the breast or uterus. Here, we report the development of structurally novel estrogens with favorable target tissue-selective estrogenic activity. Through a process of structural alteration of the hormone estradiol that preserves essential chemical and physical features of estradiol but greatly moderates its binding affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs), we obtained Pathway Preferential Estrogens (PaPEs) capable of having interaction with ER that is sufficient to activate the extranuclear-initiated signaling pathway preferentially over the direct nuclear-initiated pathway. more...

Despite the importance of X inactivation, little is known about the 3D configuration of Xi and its relationship to gene silencing. We recently showed that in humans, Xi exhibits two distinctive structural features. First, Xi is partitioned into two huge intervals, called superdomains, such that pairs of loci in each superdomain show an enhanced contact frequency with one another. more...

Yet, such drug treatments may induce alteration in the tumor’s gene expression patterns, including those of Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTA). The degradation products of such antigens can be presented as HLA peptides on the surface of the tumor cells and be developed into anti-cancer immunotherapeutics. For example, the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine) has limited anti-tumor efficacy, yet it induces the expression of many genes, including CTAs that are normally silenced in the healthy adult tissues. more...

1765. High Resolution Mapping of RNA Polymerases Identifies Mechanisms of Sensitivity and Resistance to BET Inhibitors in t(8;21) AML
(Submitter supplied) Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family inhibitors offer a new approach to treating hematological malignancies. We used precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PRO-seq) to create high-resolution maps of active RNA polymerases across the genome in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that are exceptionally sensitive to BET inhibitors. PRO-seq identified over 1400 genes showing impaired release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerases, including the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase KIT that is mutated in t(8;21) AML. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we show that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b show non-overlapping and unique patterns of genomic localization in human epidermal stem cells and their differentiated counterparts. Dnmt3a, but not Dnmt3b, binds to the TSSs of a cohort of genes required for the interaction of stem cells with their underlying stroma. Unexpectedly, TSSs bound by Dnmt3a are highly transcribed and are devoid of DNA-methylation. Conversely, Dnmt3b specifically decorates the genebody of genes that establish the stem cell and differentiated signatures. more...

The let-7 biogenesis inhibitor LIN28B  has been implicated as a critical regulator of MYCN ; however, here we show that LIN28B is dispensable for both MYCN  protein expression and growth of MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell lines despite robust de-repression of let-7 . more...

1799. Laser-capture microscopy coupled with Smart-seq2 (LCM-seq) for robust and efficient transcriptomic profiling of mouse and human tissues
(Submitter supplied) Generally, when LCM is used in diverse transcriptomic analyses, several hundred, if not thousands, of cells are needed to obtain high quality of RNA-seq data. As some cellular populations are very small and tissue often in scarcity, we aimed to carefully document the lowest number of cells needed to retrieve sequencable libraries. We started with capturing 120 cells and subsequently scaled down to 50 cells, 30 cells, 10 cells, 5 cells, 2 cells and finally 1 cell. more...

1808. Ridaforolimus (MK-8669) synergizes with Dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in hormone-sensitive breast cancer
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) represents a key downstream intermediate for a myriad of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases. In the case of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, the mTOR complex (mTORC1) mediates IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-induced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phosphorylation/activation and leads to increased proliferation and growth in breast cancer cells. As a result, the prevalence of mTOR inhibitors combined with hormonal therapy has increased in recent years. Conversely, activated mTORC1 provides negative feedback regulation of IGF signaling via insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2 serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, the IGF pathway may provide escape (e.g. de novo or acquired resistance) from mTORC1 inhibitors. It is therefore plausible that combined inhibition of mTORC1 and IGF-1R for select subsets of ER-positive breast cancer patients presents as a viable therapeutic option.   Methods: Using hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (MCF-7/AC-1), works presented herein describe the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the following compounds: dalotuzumab (DALO; “MK-0646”; anti-IGF-1R antibody), ridaforolimus (RIDA; “MK-8669”; mTORC1 small molecule inhibitor) and letrozole (“LET”, aromatase inhibitor).   Results: With the exception of MK-0646, all single agent and combination treatment arms effectively inhibited xenograft tumor growth, albeit to varying degrees. Correlative tissue analyses revealed MK-0646 alone and in combination with LET induced insulin receptor alpha A (InsR-A) isoform upregulation (both mRNA and protein expression), thereby further supporting a triple therapy approach.   Conclusion: These data provide preclinical rationalization towards the combined triple therapy of LET plus MK-0646 plus MK-8669 as an efficacious anti-tumor strategy for ER-positive breast tumors.

(Submitter supplied) Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common neuropathological finding of medically intractable cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common form of partial epilepsy. Within the dentate gyrus, HS may be associated with granule cell dispersion and aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, and these pathological changes are accompanied by a range of molecular changes. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of dentate granule cells of MTLE patients with and without HS to show that next-generation sequencing methods can produce interpretable genomic data from RNA collected from small homogenous cell populations and to shed light on the transcriptional changes associated with HS.

1831. Chromatin accessibility maps of chronic lymphocytic leukemia identify subtype-specific epigenome signatures and transcription regulatory networks
(Submitter supplied) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by substantial clinical heterogeneity, despite relatively few genetic alterations. To provide a basis for studying epigenome deregulation in CLL, we established genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps for 88 CLL samples from 55 patients using the ATAC-seq assay, and we also performed ChIPmentation and RNA-seq profiling for ten representative samples. more...

1832. m6A level and isoform characterization sequencing (m6A-LAIC-seq) reveal the census and complexity of the m6A epitranscriptome
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a widespread reversible chemical modification of RNAs, implicated in many aspects of RNA metabolism. Little quantitative information exists as to either how many transcript copies of particular genes are m6A modified (“m6A levels”), or the relationship of m6A modification(s) to alternative RNA isoforms. To deconvolute the m6A epitranscriptome, we developed m6A level and isoform-characterization sequencing (m6A-LAIC-seq). more...

1862. Robust inference of cell-to-cell expression variations from single- and k-cell profiling (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Quantifying heterogeneity in gene expression among single cells can reveal information inaccessible to cell-population measurements. However, the levels of many transcripts in single cells fall below the detection limit of even the most sensitive technologies currently available. One proposed approach to overcome this challenge is to measure random pools of k cells (e.g., 10) to increase sensitivity, followed by computational deconvolution of cellular heterogeneity parameters (CHPs), such as the biological variance of single-cell expression levels. more...

1864. A splicing switch of TEAD4 regulates Hippo-YAP signaling pathway to inhibit tumor proliferation
(Submitter supplied) Splicing dysregulations extensively occur in cancers, yet the biological consequences of such alterations are mostly undefined. Here we report that the Hippo-YAP signaling, a key pathway that regulates cell proliferation and organ size, is under control of a new splicing switch. We show that TEAD4, the transcription factor that mediates Hippo-YAP signaling, undergoes alternative splicing facilitated by the tumor suppressor RBM4, producing a truncated isoform, TEAD4-S, which lacks N-terminal DNA-binding domain but maintains YAP-interaction domain. more...

1867. Rocaglamide A converts RNA helicase eIF4A into a sequence-specific translational repressor
(Submitter supplied) Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a novel class of protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively kill aneuploid tumor cells and repress translation of specific mRNAs. RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase, and its mRNA selectivity is proposed to reflect highly structured 5′ UTRs that are very dependent on eIF4A-mediated unwinding. Here, we show that secondary structure in 5′ UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress translation by reducing eIF4A activity. more...

1889. NAD+ Analog-sensitive PARPs Reveal a Role for PARP-1 in Transcription Elongation
(Submitter supplied) The PARP family of proteins comprises 17 members, about two thirds of which are active mono- or poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase enzymes that transfer the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ onto target proteins.  In many cases, ADP-ribosylation, which plays critical roles in human diseases (e.g., cancer, heart disease, and neuropathies) is associated with abrogation of the molecular functions of the target.  Discerning ADP-ribosylation events mediated by a specific PARP is challenging, since all PARPs use the same substrate (i.e., NAD+) and the available inhibitors lack the specificity needed to make such conclusions. more...

1937. miRNA-mediated expression switch of cell adhesion genes driven by microcirculation in chip
(Submitter supplied) Changes in cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression and miRNAs regulating them are known to be involved in malignant progression in colon cancer. We investigated expression profiles of CAM genes and non-coding RNAs in CaCo2 colon cancer cells in static culture and under dynamic flow conditions perfused in microfluidic chip emulating physiological microenvironment. We incubated monolayers of CaCo2 cells in Transwell® units either under static conditions or under flow in a microfluidic chip. more...

1938. Coupled electrophysiological recording and single-cell transcriptome analyses revealed molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal maturation
(Submitter supplied) The mammalian brain is heterogeneous, containing billions of neurons and trillions of synapses forming various neural circuitries, through which sense, movement, thought, and emotion are generated. The cellular heterogeneity of the brain has made it difficult to study the molecular logic of neural circuitry wiring, pruning, activation, and plasticity, until recently, transcriptome analyses with single-cell resolution makes decoding of gene regulatory networks underlying aforementioned circuitry properties possible. more...

1939. Transcription Profiles of Regulatory T Cells in Follicular Lymphoma Lymph Nodes, Normal Lymph Nodes and Reactive Lymph Nodes
(Submitter supplied) We have previously shown that Tregs infiltrating follicular lymphoma lymph nodes (FLN) are quantitatively and qualitatively different than those infiltrating normal and reactive nodes (NLN, RLN, respectively). To gain insight into how such Treg populations differ, we performed RNA sequence (RNAseq) analyses on flow sorted Tregs from all three sources. We identify several molecules that could contribute to the observed increased suppressive capacity of FLN tregs, including upregulation of CTLA-4, IL-10, and GITR, all confirmed by protein expression. more...

1940. Whole organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing
(Submitter supplied) Multicellular systems develop from single cells through a lineage, but current lineage tracing approaches scale poorly to whole organisms. Here we use genome editing to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode, an array of CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, records lineage relationships in the patterns of mutations shared between cells. more...

2023. The RNA-binding profile of Acinus, a peripheral component of the Exon junction complex, reveals its role in splicing regulation
(Submitter supplied) Acinus (Apoptotic Chromatin Condensation Inducer in the Nucleus) is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) originally identified for its role in apoptosis. It was later found to be an auxiliary component of the Exon Junction Complex (EJC), which is deposited at exon junctions as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing. To uncover the cellular functions of Acinus and investigate its role in splicing, we mapped its endogenous RNA targets using individual-nucleotide resolution UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). more...

2024. Fra-1 is a key driver of colon cancer metastasis and a Fra-1 classifier predicts disease-free survival
(Submitter supplied) Background and Aim: Fra-1 (Fos-related antigen-1) is a member of the AP1 (activator protein-1) family of transcription factors. We have recently shown that Fra-1 is necessary for breast cancer cells to metastasize in vivo, and that breast cancer outcome can be predicted by a classifier comprising genes that are expressed in a Fra-1-dependent fashion. Here, we show that Fra-1 plays an important role also in colon cancer progression. more...

2074. Capturing the dynamic nascent transcriptome during acute cellular responses: the serum response
(Submitter supplied) Dynamic regulation of gene expression via signal transduction pathways is of fundamental importance during many biological processes such as cell state transitioning, cell cycle progression and stress responses. In this study we used serum stimulation as a cell response paradigm to apply the nascent RNA Bru-seq technique in order to capture early dynamic changes in the nascent transcriptome. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the dynamics of genome- wide transcription during the first two hours of serum stimulation in human fibroblasts. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cancer stem cells (CSC) dictate tumor cell heterogeneity in diverse cancer types and arise, in part, from microRNA (miRNA)-dependent alteration of gene expression. The let-7 miRNA family induces differentiation by silencing genes that maintain stemness and is repressed by the RNA-binding proteins LIN28A/B, which preserve stemness in normal embryonic and malignant cells. Here, we observed that LIN28A/B is undetectable in glioma stem cells (GSC) whereas let-7 and, paradoxically, their target genes are highly expressed. more...

Here we report that EZH1 physically interacts with UXT, one small chaperon-like transcription co-activator of NF-κB. UXT specifically interacts with EZH1 and SUZ12, but not EED or EZH2. Similar to UXT, RNA interference of EZH1 and SUZ12 in the cell impairs the transcriptional activation of NF-κB target genes after TNFα treatment, and increases the induced cell death. more...

(Submitter supplied) In the mouse, germ cells and embryonic stem cells maintain an epigenetically poised (bivalent) state, defined by the simultaneous presence of the opposing histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and by transcriptional repression, at the promoters of many developmental regulatory genes. We compared genome-wide chromatin state in male germ cells of five mammalian and one avian species. We identified a set of 405 genes whose promoters retain poised chromatin in the mammalian germ line throughout mammalian evolution.

2123. Cooperation of Nutlin-3a and a Wip1 inhibitor to induce p53 activity
(Submitter supplied) Targeting the Mdm2 oncoprotein by drugs has the potential of re-establishing p53 function and tumor suppression. However, Mdm2-antagonizing drug candidates, e. g. Nutlin-3a, often fail to abolish cancer cell growth sustainably. To overcome these limitations, we inhibited Mdm2 and simultaneously a second negative regulator of p53, the phosphatase Wip1/PPM1D. When combining Nutlin-3a with the Wip1 inhibitor GSK2830371 in the treatment of p53-proficient but not p53-deficient cells, we observed enhanced phosphorylation (Ser 15) and acetylation (Lys 382) of p53, increased expression of p53 target gene products, and synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. more...

2147. Montelukast counteracts the influenza virus-induced block in unfolded protein stress response and reduces virus multiplication
(Submitter supplied) Influenza A viruses generate annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory disease with important consequences for human health and economy. Therefore, a large effort has been devoted to the development of new anti-influenza drugs directed to viral targets, as well as to the identification of cellular targets amenable for anti-influenza therapy. Here we describe a new approach to identify such potential cellular targets by screening collections of drugs approved for human use. more...

2149. Transcriptome of human ILC2s; primary vs IL-1b-primed
(Submitter supplied) ILC2s regulate type2 immune responses and protect against helminth infection. We found that ILC2s can be expanded in the presence of a combination of cytokines IL-2 and IL-1b. To better understand the functional and phenotypic consequence of IL-1β activation of ILC2s, we utilized whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of freshly isolated ILC2s and IL-1β-primed ILC2s. Differential expression analysis revealed a substantial number of genes underwent significant change between the two conditions (total 4,744 gene, FDR<0.01, Fold change >2), among which 3,871 genes were upregulated in IL-1β –primed ILC2s.

2184. Study of Topoisomerase I in human
(Submitter supplied) We report a mechanism through which the transcription machinery directly controls topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity to adjust DNA topology throughout the transcription cycle. By comparing TOP1 occupancy using ChIP-Seq, versus TOP1 activity using TOP1-Seq, a method reported here to map catalytically engaged TOP1, TOP1 bound at promoters was discovered to become fully active only after pause-release. This transition coupled the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal-domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with stimulation of TOP1 above its basal rate, enhancing its processivity. more...

2186. A coding sequence-embedded principle governs translational reading frame fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Upon initiation at an AUG start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. Although some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3’ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. more...

(Submitter supplied) The skin is a squamous epithelium that is continuously renewed by a population of basal layer stem/progenitor cells and can heal wounds. Here, we show that the transcription regulators YAP and TAZ localise to the nucleus in the basal layer of skin and are elevated upon wound healing. Skin-specific deletion of both YAP and TAZ in adult mice slows proliferation of basal layer cells, leads to hair loss and impairs regeneration after wounding. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is formed by heterogeneous ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. The patho-mechanism of OPLL is still largely unknown. MicroRNAs are small nucleatides that function as regulators of gene expression in almost any biological process. However, few microRNAs are reported to have a role in the pathological process of OPLL. Therefore, we performed high-throughput microRNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing of primary OPLL and PLL cells in order to decipher the interacting network of microRNAs in OPLL.

2218. Regulation of poly(A) tail and translation during the somatic cell cycle
(Submitter supplied) Poly(A) tails are critical for mRNA stability and translation. However, recent studies have challenged this view, showing that poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency are decoupled in non-embryonic cells. Using TAIL-seq and ribosome profiling, we investigate poly(A) tail dynamics and translational control in the somatic cell cycle. We find dramatic changes in poly(A) tail lengths of cell cycle regulatory genes like CDK1, TOP2A, and FBXO5, explaining their translational repression in M phase. more...

2249. CLIC5: a novel ETV6 target gene in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Background: The most common rearrangement in childhood precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) is the t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation resulting in the ETV6-AML1 fusion gene. A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of pre-B ALL. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear Results: To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and pre-B ALL patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. more...

2474. GAS5 controls Nodal autocrine in Human Embryonic Stem Cells Self-Renewal through competing endogenous mechanism
(Submitter supplied) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recently characterized players that are involved in the regulatory circuitry of self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). However, the specific roles of lncRNAs in this circuitry are poorly understood. Here, we determined that growth-arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5), which is a known tumor suppressor and growth arrest gene, is abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of hESCs and essential for hESC self-renewal. more...

2476. BBBomics - Human Blood Brain Barrier Transcriptomics Hub [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Functional and structural dysfunction of the blood brain barrier (BBB) leads to severe alterations in brain physiology and is believed to trigger neurodegeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the BBB dysfunction, very few human BBB cell culture models are available; of which, the human microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) is the most widely used. Thus far, array-based approaches or targeted seqeuncing based approaches have been employed to characterize the gene expression of the hCMEC/D3 model. more...

(Submitter supplied) mTOR regulates mRNA translation. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that mTOR exclusively stimulates translation of TOP (containing a 5’-terminal oligopyrimidine [5’TOP] motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling implied that mTOR also modulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. We show that ribosome-, but not polysome-profiling, is biased towards identification of TOP mRNAs as differentially translated while obscuring detection of changes in non-TOP mRNA translation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ectopic expression of the double homeodomain transcription factor DUX4 causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Mechanisms of action of DUX4 are currently unknown. Using immortalized human myoblasts with a titratable DUX4 transgene, we identify by mass spectrometry an interaction between the DUX4 C-terminus and the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that DUX4 recruits p300 to its target gene, ZSCAN4, displaces histone H3 from the center of its binding site, and induces H3K27Ac in its vicinity, but C-terminal deleted DUX4 does not. more...

Using various AAV-shRNA vectors under the high-expressing U6 and low-expressing H1 promoters, we found that dose-limiting toxicity was strongly correlated with an shRNA concentration of  >12% of total microRNA levels.  Toxicity was associated with a specific reduction in the first synthesized 22nt isoform of miR-122-5p, resulting in the specific de-repression of miR-122 target mRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) The androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3)  to an AR–ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. more...

2547. Large-scale profiling of intracellular signalling pathway activation reveals major distinctions between airway smooth muscle cells of asthmatics and non-asthmatics.
(Submitter supplied) Signalling pathways regulate all major cellular events in health and disease, including asthma development and progression. Complexity of human intracellular signalization can be explored using novel systemic approaches that exploit whole-transcriptome analysis. Cap-analysis-of-gene-expression (CAGE) is a method of choice for generating transcriptome libraries, as it interrogates only terminally capped mRNAs that have the highest probability to be translated into protein. more...

2558. Comprehensive Evaluation of AmpliSeq Transcriptome, a Novel Targeted Whole Transcriptome RNA Sequencing Methodology for Global Gene Expression Analysis.
(Submitter supplied) Background: Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) represents a powerful approach for whole transcriptome gene expression analysis.  However, RNA-seq carries a few limitations, e.g., the requirement of a significant amount of input RNA and complications led by non-specific mapping of short reads. The Ion AmpliSeqTM Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (AmpliSeq) was recently introduced by Life Technologies as a whole-transcriptome, targeted gene quantification kit to overcome these limitations of RNA-seq.To assess the performance of this new methodology, we performed a comprehensive comparison of AmpliSeq with RNA-seq using two well-established next-generation sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq and Ion Torrent Proton). more...

2574. Reversion to naïve human pluripotency creates a new methylation landscape devoid of blastocyst or germline memory
(Submitter supplied) Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) typically exhibit "primed" pluripotency, analogous to stem cells derived from the mouse post-implantation epiblast. This has led to a search for growth conditions that support self-renewal of hESCs akin to hypomethylated naïve epiblast cells in human pre-implantation embryos. We have discovered that reverting primed hESCs to a hypomethylated naïve state or deriving a new hESC line under naïve conditions results in the establishment of Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen 4 (SSEA4) negative hESC lines with a transcriptional program resembling the human pre-implantation epiblast. more...

2580. Effects of Freeze-Thawing and Intravenous Infusion on Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Gene Expression
(Submitter supplied) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are increasingly used as an investigative therapeutic product for immune disorders and degenerative disease. Typically, MSC are isolated from human tissue, expanded in culture and cryopreserved until usage. The safety and efficacy of MSC therapy will depend on the phenotypical and functional characteristics of MSC. The freeze-thawing procedure may change these characteristics. more...

(Submitter supplied) Loss-of-function studies are fundamental for dissecting gene function. Yet, methods to rapidly and effectively perturb genes in mammalian cells are scarce. We present a novel system, deliverable with only two lentiviral vectors, which enables simultaneous control over two different proteins in the same cell. By harnessing the plant auxin and jasmonate hormone-induced degradation pathways, combined with RNA interference, this system allows constitutive depletion of two endogenous proteins and their replacement with two exogenous proteins whose degradation is rapidly and reversibly induced by external ligands, representing a dual analog molecular tuner. more...

The ambient atmospheric O2 (21%) is known to induce cell proliferation defects and cellular senescence in stem cell and primary cell cultures. Therefore, culturing these cells under lower O2 levels (2-9%) is currently a standard practice. However, the non-cancerous immortalized cells and cancer cells, which evade cellular senescence are normally cultured under 21% O2 levels and the effects of higher O2 levels on these cells are not fully understood. more...

2618. Strong Components of Epigenetic Memory in Cultured Human Fibroblasts Related to Site of Origin and Donor Age (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Differentiating pluripotent cells from fibroblast progenitors is a potentially transformative tool in personalized medicine. We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). more...

2627. BPTF is required for c-MYC-induced remodelling of target chromatin and transcriptional activation [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The c-MYC oncogene is a key transcription factor deregulated in most human tumors. Histone marks associated with transcriptionally active genes in euchromatic islands define the set of high-affinity c-MYC targets. The mechanisms involved in their recognition by c-MYC are not known but likely involve chromatin-remodelling and chromatin-modifying complexes. Here, we show that c-MYC interacts with BPTF, a core subunit of the NURF complex that binds active chromatin. more...

A molecular understanding of the functional consequences of this genetic variation is complicated because most GWAS SNPs are located in non-coding regions. After identifying H3K27Ac peaks in HCT116 colon cancer cells that harbor SNPs associated with an increased risk for CRC, we used CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease to delete 2 CRC risk-associated H3K27Ac peaks (E7 and E24), a peak that is not associated with CRC risk (18qE) and a region that doesn?t have H3K27Ac peak (18qNE) from HCT116 cells and analyzed effects on the transcriptome and epigenome. more...

Here, we identify all CNBP isoforms as cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins. Using Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside Enhanced Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation, we mapped its binding sites on RNA at nucleotide-level resolution on a genome-wide scale and find that CNBP interacted with 3961 mRNAs in human cell lines, preferentially at a G-rich motif close to the AUG start codon on mature mRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are an underused resource for molecular analyses. This proof of concept study aimed to compare RNAseq results from FFPE biopsies with the corresponding RNAlater® (Qiagen, Germany) stored samples from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients, to enable the decision of whether or not it is feasible to apply RNAseq technology to archival tissue. Core biopsies were obtained with a 16g needle from 16 patients undergoing partial or full nephrectomy. The RNA sequencing libraries were generated applying the new Illumina TruSeq® Access library preparation protocol.

2652. Evolutionary analysis across mammals reveals distinct classes of long noncoding RNAs
(Submitter supplied) Recent advances in transcriptome sequencing have enabled the discovery of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across many species. Though several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs remain unknown. Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: identifying truly non-coding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and prioritizing the hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs for downstream experimental interrogation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Coordination of a complex series of transcriptional, structural and signaling events culminates in cellular senescence, a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism. We have discovered a repressor complex composed of TBX3 and CAPERa which functions upstream of the RB and p53 effector pathways and is required to prevent senescence of primary cells and in mouse embryos. TBX3/ CAPERa directly binds and represses transcription and chromatin structure of genes in multiple senescence pathways and the LncRNA UCA1, which we have identified as a novel tumor suppressor. more...

(Submitter supplied) Small molecule inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins are in clinical trials for a variety of cancers, but patient selection strategies are limited.  This is due in part to the heterogeneity of response following BET inhibition (BETi), which includes differentiation, senescence, and cell death in subsets of cancer cell lines.  To elucidate the dominant features defining response to BETi, we carried out phenotypic and gene expression analysis of both treatment naïve cell lines and engineered tolerant lines. more...

Here we report the preferential and high sensitivity of TNBCs to BET bromodomain inhibitors such as JQ1 manifested by cell cycle arrest in early G1, apoptosis, and induction of markers of luminal epithelial differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The sensitivity of TNBC and other tumor types to BET inhibition establishes a rationale for clinical investigation, and a motivation to understand mechanisms of resistance. more...

Here, we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Phenotypic effects are preceded by the direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4 and the subsequent down-regulation of the IRF4 transcriptional program. more...

(Submitter supplied) Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly implicated as gene regulators and may ultimately be more numerous than protein-coding genes in the human genome. Despite large numbers of reported lncRNAs, reference annotations are likely incomplete due to their lower and tighter tissue-specific expression compared to mRNAs. An unexplored factor potentially confounding lncRNA identification is inter-individual expression variability. more...

2669. Ubiquitin-dependent turnover of MYC promotes loading of the PAF complex on RNA Polymerase II to drive transcriptional elongation (RNA-seq)
(Submitter supplied) The MYC transcription factor is an unstable protein and its turnover is controlled by the ubiquitin system. Ubiquitination enhances MYC-dependent transactivation, but the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. Here we show that proteasomal turnover of MYC is dispensable for recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but is required to promote transcriptional elongation at MYC target genes. Degradation of MYC stimulates histone acetylation and recruitment of BRD4 and P-TEFb to target promoters, leading to phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD and the release of elongating RNAPII. more...

(Submitter supplied) Intragenic 5-methylcytosine and CTCF mediate opposing affects on pre-mRNA splicing: CTCF promotes inclusion of weak upstream exons through RNA polymerase II pausing, whereas 5-methylcytosine evicts CTCF, leading to exon exclusion. However, the mechanisms governing dynamic DNA methylation at CTCF binding sites were unclear. In this study, we identify the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives.

2715. Dual RNA-seq – High-resolution comparative Dual RNA-seq time-course
(Submitter supplied) Bacteria possess many small noncoding RNAs whose regulatory roles in pathogenesis are little understood due to a paucity of macroscopic phenotypes in standard virulence assays. Here, we use a novel Dual RNA-seq approach for a single-step simultaneous RNA profiling in both pathogen and host to reveal molecular phenotypes of sRNAs during infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. We identify a new PhoP/Q-activated small RNA which upon bacterial internalization acts to temporally control the expression of both, invasion-associated effectors and virulence genes required for intracellular survival. more...

2717. Downregulation of LATS kinases alters p53 to promote cell migration
(Submitter supplied) p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its association with the p52 NF-?B subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53’s conformation and transcriptional output towards a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants, and endow p53 with the ability to promote cell migration. more...

2724. RNA Polymerase II-associated factor 1 regulates the release and phosphorylation of paused RNA Polymerase II
(Submitter supplied) Release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early elongation is a critical step in transcriptional regulation in metazoan cells. Paused Pol II release is thought to require the kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) for the phosphorylation of DRB sensitivity-inducing factor, negative elongation factor, and C-terminal domain (CTD) serine-2 of Pol II. We found that Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) is a critical regulator of paused Pol II release, that positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) directly regulates the initial recruitment of PAF1 complex (PAF1C) to genes, and that the subsequent recruitment of CDK12 is dependent on PAF1C. more...

2726. Limiting cholesterol biosynthetic flux engages type I IFN signaling in a STING-dependent manner
(Submitter supplied) Cellular lipid requirements are achieved through a combination of biosynthesis and import programs. Using isotope tracer analysis, we show that type I interferon (IFN) signaling rapidly shifts the balance of these programs by decreasing synthesis and increasing import of cholesterol and long chain fatty acids. Genetically enforcing this metabolic shift in macrophages is sufficient to render mice resistant to viral challenge, demonstrating the importance of reprogramming the balance of these two metabolic pathways in vivo. more...

(Submitter supplied) The ability to perturb genes in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. To extend the catalog of human core and context- dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. more...

2762. An aspartyl protease defines a novel pathway for export of Toxoplasma proteins into the host cell
(Submitter supplied) Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular Apicomplexan parasite capable of invading and surviving within nucleated cells in most warm-blooded animals. This remarkable task is achieved through the delivery of effector proteins from the parasite into the parasitophorous vacuole and host cell cytosol that rewire host cellular pathways, facilitating parasite evasion of the immune system. Here, we have identified a novel export pathway in Toxoplasma that involves cleavage of effector proteins by the Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5) prior to translocation into the host cell. more...

2818. Identifying Glioblastoma Gene Networks Based on Hypergeometric Test Analysis
(Submitter supplied) Patient specific therapy is emerging as an important possibility for many cancer patients.  However, to identify such therapies it is essential to determine the genomic and transcriptional alterations present in one tumor relative to control samples. This presents a challenge since use of a single sample precludes many standard statistical analysis techniques.  We reasoned that one means of addressing this issue is by comparing transcriptional changes in one tumor with those observed in a large cohort of patients analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). more...

2822. Aneuploidy-induced cellular stresses limit autophagic degradation.
(Submitter supplied) An unbalanced karyotype, a condition known as aneuploidy, has a profound impact on cellular physiology and is a hallmark of cancer. Determining how aneuploidy affects cells is thus critical to understanding tumorigenesis. Here we show that aneuploidy interferes with the degradation of autophagosomes within lysosomes. Mis-folded proteins that accumulate in aneuploid cells due to aneuploidy-induced proteomic changes overwhelm the lysosome with cargo, leading to the observed lysosomal degradation defects. more...

Here, we devised a strategy to assess the contribution of clonal growth, reprogramming method and genetic background to transcriptional patterns in hESCs and hiPSCs. Surprisingly, transcriptional variation originating from two different genetic backgrounds was dominant over variation due to the reprogramming method or cell type of origin of pluripotent cell lines. more...

2830. Transcriptome response to 4h IL-1b stimulation of primary chondrocytes
(Submitter supplied) Using RNA sequencing (Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 sequencer) we report the transcriptome profile of primary human chondrocytes isolated from patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and the transcriptome response of these cells to 4h stimulation with IL-1β (1ng/ml).  In total, 983 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified, which included 642 intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 124 antisense and pseudogenes.  Less than 4% of the identified lncRNAs overlapped with putative eRNAs regions, and visual inspection showed that they were uni-directional and multi-exonic.  Upon  IL-1β stimulation 499 protein-coding genes were differentially expressed, and 158 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, including 92 lincRNAs, 13 antisense and 18 psudogenes.  This study demonstrates that IL-1β induces a rapid and widespread change in the transcriptome of the primary human OA chondrocyte.

Fusions of the nuclease-inactive dCas9 to the KRAB repressor domain (dCas9-KRAB) can effectively silence target gene expression.  We targeted dCas9-KRAB to the HS2 enhancer, a distal regulatory element that orchestrates the expression of multiple globin genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The human nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 has been implicated in the decay of nuclear noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition, PABPN1 stimulates hyperadenylation by poly(A) polymerase, and this activity is thought to be required for decay. Here, we inactivated hyperadenylation by two distinct mechanisms and examined changes in gene expression in HEK293 cells by RNAseq. We observed the upregulation of various ncRNAs, including snoRNA host genes, primary miRNA transcripts, and upstream antisense RNAs, confirming that hyperadenylation is broadly required for the degradation of PABPN1-targets. more...

2850. Perturbations of PIP3 signaling trigger a global remodeling of mRNA landscape and reveal a transcriptional feedback loop
(Submitter supplied) PIP3 is synthesized by PI3Ks and regulates complex cell responses, such as growth and migration. Signals that drive long-term reshaping of cell phenotypes are difficult to resolve because of complex feedback networks that operate over extended times. It is clear PIP3-dependent modulation of mRNA accumulation is important in this process but is poorly understood. We have quantified the genome-wide mRNA-landscape of non-transformed, breast epithelium-derived MCF10a cells and its response to transient (EGF or PI3Ka-selective inhibitor) or chronic (isogenic cells expressing an oncomutant PI3Ka allele or lacking the PIP3-phosphatase /tumour-suppressor, PTEN) perturbations of PIP3.These results show that whilst many mRNAs are changed by long-term  genetic perturbation of PIP3 signaling (“butterfly effect”), a much smaller number change with a directional logic that aligns with different PIP3 perturbations, allowing discrimination of more directly regulated mRNAs. more...

2901. PER2 synchronizes mitotic expansion and decidual transformation of human endometrial stromal cells
(Submitter supplied) Implantation is dependent on synchronized interactions between the conceptus and surrounding decidual cells but the involvement of clock genes in this process is not well understood. Circadian oscillations are predicated on transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balance the activities of the transcriptional activators CLOCK and BMAL1 and repressors encoded by PER and CRY genes. Here we show that loss of PER2 expression silences circadian oscillations in decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). more...

2905. RNAseq changes in pre MAPKi treatment and post MAPKi resistance Melanomas
(Submitter supplied) Melanoma resistance to MAPK- or T cell checkpoint-targeted therapies represents a major clinical challenge, and treatment failures of MAPK-targeted therapies due to acquired resistance often require salvage immunotherapies. We show that genomic analysis of acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors revealed key driver genes but failedto adequately account for clinical resistance. From a large-scale comparative analysis of temporal transcriptomes from patient-matched tumor biopsies, we discovered highly recurrent differential expression and signature outputs of c-MET, LEF1 and YAP1 as drivers of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. more...

To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukemia, we performed a chromatin-focused shRNAmir screen in a sensitive MLL/AF9; NrasG12D‑driven AML model, and investigated dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant murine and human leukemias. more...

2925. Pre-patterning of differentiation-driven nuclear lamin A/C-associated chromatin domains by GlcNAcylated histone H2B
(Submitter supplied) Dynamic interactions of nuclear lamins with chromatin through so-called lamin-associated domains (LADs) contribute to spatial arrangements of the genome. Here, we provide evidence for pre-patterning of differentiation-driven formation of lamin A/C LADs by domains of histone H2B modified by the nutrient sensor O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (H2BGlcNAc), which we term GADs. We demonstrate a two-step process of lamin A/C LAD formation during in vitro adipogenesis, involving (i) a spreading of lamin A/C-chromatin interactions during the transition from progenitor cell proliferation to cell cycle arrest, and (ii) a genome-scale redistribution these interactions through a process of LAD ‘exchange’ within hours of adipogenic induction. more...

(Submitter supplied) c-MYC (MYC) overexpression or hyperactivation is one of the most common drivers of human cancer. Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. Like other classic oncogenes, hyperactivation of MYC leads to collateral stresses onto cancer cells, suggesting that tumors harbor unique vulnerabilities arising from oncogenic activation of MYC. Herein, we discover the spliceosome as a new target of oncogenic stress in MYC-driven cancers. more...

(Submitter supplied) Estrogens play an important role in breast cancer (BC) development and progression, where the two isoforms of the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) are generally co-expressed and mediate the effects of these hormones in cancer cells. ERβ has been suggested to exert an antagonist role toward the oncogenic activities of ERα, and for this reason it is considered an oncosuppressor. As clinical evidence regarding a prognostic role for this receptor subtype in hormone-responsive BC is still limited and conflicting, more knowledge is required on the biological functions of ERβ in cancer cells. more...

2942. Whole cell mRNA expression profiling in control and complex I deficient patient fibroblasts incubated with DMSO, AICAR, chloramphenicol, and resveratrol
(Submitter supplied) Background: Transcription control of mitochondrial metabolism is essential for cellular function. A better understanding of this process will aid the elucidation of mitochondrial disorders, in particular of the many genetically unsolved cases of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency. Yet, to date only few studies have investigated nuclear gene regulation in the context of OXPHOS deficiency. In this study, we combined RNA sequencing of human complex I-deficient patient cells across 32 conditions of perturbed mitochondrial metabolism, with a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns, co-expression calculations and transcription factor binding sites. Results: Our analysis shows that OXPHOS genes have a significantly higher co-expression with each other than with other genes, including mitochondrial genes. We found no evidence for complex-specific mRNA expression regulation in the tested cell types and conditions: subunits of different OXPHOS complexes are similarly (co-)expressed and regulated by a common set of transcription factors. However, we did observe significant differences between the expression of OXPHOS complex subunits compared to assembly factors, suggesting divergent transcription programs. Furthermore, complex I co-expression calculations identified 684 genes with a likely role in OXPHOS biogenesis and function. Analysis of evolutionarily conserved transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of these genes revealed almost all known OXPHOS regulators (including GABP, NRF1/2, SP1, YY1, E-box factors) and a set of six yet uncharacterized candidate transcription factors (ELK1, KLF7, SP4, EHF, ZNF143, and EL2). Conclusions: OXPHOS genes share an expression program distinct from other mitochondrial genes, indicative of targeted regulation of this mitochondrial sub-process. Within the subset of OXPHOS genes we established a difference in expression between subunits and assembly factors. Most transcription regulators of genes that co-express with complex I are well-established factors for OXPHOS biogenesis. For the remaining six factors we here suggest for the first time a link with transcription regulation in OXPHOS deficiency.

2951. Single-Cell RNA-seq Defines the Three Cell Lineages of the Human Blastocyst
(Submitter supplied) Here we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human-specific. Importantly, we validate our RNA-sequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast including the transcription factor KLF17. more...

However, in clinically occurring carcinomas, density and proliferation of CAFs are frequently increased rather than decreased. We previously showed that genetic deletion or down-modulation of the canonical Notch effector CSL/RBP-Jκ in skin dermal fibroblasts is sufficient for CAF activation with consequent development of multifocal keratinocyte tumors. more...

(Submitter supplied) To comprehensively characterize microRNAs (miRNA) expression and their target genes in thyroid cancer, we performed next-generation sequencing expression analysis of this disease. Recent studies have found that only the most abundant microRNAs mediate significant target suppression. We sequenced small RNA from 8 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) with paired samples of normal thyroid tissue. We found that only a small set of abundant miRNAs are differentially expressed after pair-wise comparison (12 upregulated and 8 downregulated) reaching the minimum threshold amount to repress target mRNAs. more...

2963. Mitotic stress is an integral part of the oncogene-induced senescence program that promotes multinucleation and cell cycle arrest
(Submitter supplied) Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor suppression mechanism that blocks cell proliferation in response to oncogenic signalling. OIS is frequently accompanied by multinucleation; however, the origin of this is unknown. Here we show that multinucleate OIS cells originated mostly from failed mitosis. Prior to senescence, mutant RasV12 activation in primary human fibroblasts compromised mitosis, associated with abnormal expression of mitotic genes that enter M-phase. more...

Many commercially ovarian cancer cell lines are not good models for HGSC. Here we demonstrate that 3 low passage cell lines derived from HGSC have similar transcriptomes to their parental bulk tumors. These cell lines recapitulated tumor characteristics of the primary cancer and had responded to therapy in the same manner as primary HGSC cells, demonstrating they are accurate models for HGSCs.

2983. The Cushing's disease adipose gene expression profile reveals effects of long term glucocorticoids on adipose tissue lipid, protein and glucose metabolism
(Submitter supplied) Glucocorticoids have major effects on adipose tissue metabolism. To study tissue mRNA expression changes induced by chronic elevated endogenous glucocorticoids, we performed RNA sequencing on subcutaneous adipose tissue from patients with Cushing’s disease (n=5) compared to patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas (n=11). We found higher expression of transcripts involved in several metabolic pathways, including lipogenesis, proteolysis and glucose oxidation as well as decreased expression of transcripts involved in inflammation and protein synthesis. more...

2985. MBNL Sequestration by Toxic RNAs and RNA Mis-Processing in the Myotonic Dystrophy Brain
(Submitter supplied) For some neurological disorders, disease is primarily RNA-mediated due to expression of non-coding microsatellite expansion RNAs (RNAexp). Toxicity is thought to result from enhanced binding of proteins to these expansions and depletion from their normal cellular targets. However, experimental evidence for this sequestration model is lacking. Here, we use HITS-CLIP and pre-mRNA processing analysis of human control versus myotonic dystrophy (DM) brains to provide compelling evidence for this RNA toxicity model. more...

(Submitter supplied) In this study, we have integrated RNA-seq data from subcellular fractionated RNA (i.e., cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and chromatin-associated) with GRO-seq data using a novel bioinformatics pipeline. This has yielded a comprehensive catalog of polyadenylated lncRNAs in MCF-7 cells, about half of which have not been annotated previously and about a quarter of which are estrogen-regulated. Knockdown of selected lncRNAs, such as lncRNA152 and lncRNA67 followed by RNA-seq suggest that these lncRNAs regulate the expression of cell cycle genes.

(Submitter supplied) CTCF and BORIS (CTCFL), two paralogous mammalian proteins sharing nearly identical DNA binding domains, are thought to function in mutually exclusive manners in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Here we show that these two proteins co-occupy a specific subset of regulatory elements consisting of clustered CTCF binding motifs (termed 2xCTSes). BORIS occupancy at 2xCTSes is largely invariant in BORIS-positive cancer cells, with the genomic pattern recapitulating the germline-specific BORIS binding to chromatin. more...

Here, we applied PAR-CLIP to human RC3H1 to identify about 3800 mRNA targets with more than 16000 binding sites. A large number of sites are distinct from the consensus CDE and revealed a structure-sequence motif with U-rich sequences embedded in hairpins. RC3H1 binds preferentially short-lived and DNA damage induced mRNAs, indicating a role of this RNA-binding protein in the posttranscriptional regulation of the DNA damage response. more...

3018. Interphase condensins regulate ligand-depedent enhancer activation (GRO-seq)
(Submitter supplied) An emerging theme of gene regulation is the involvement of architectural chromosomal molecules in transcription control. Condensins are critical regulators of mitotic chromosomes, but their interphase chromatin localization and functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that both the condensin I and condensin II complexes exhibit an unexpected, dramatic 17-?-estradiol-induced preferential recruitment to oestrogen receptor ? (ER-?)-bound active enhancers in interphase breast cancer cells, exhibiting non-canonical interaction with ER-? distinct from classic cofactors. more...

(Submitter supplied) General activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways is classically associated with adverse prognosis in cancer and has been proposed to contribute to oncogenic drive. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) HIF pathways are upregulated by inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor. However HIF-1a and HIF-2a have contrasting effects on experimental tumour progression. To better understand this paradox we examined pan-genomic patterns of HIF DNA binding and associated gene expression in response to manipulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a and related the findings to CCRC prognosis. more...

First, IPSDM lost expression of pluripotency markers, had remarkably distinct gene expression profiles relative to precursor iPSCs, and had largely similar gene expression as HMDM. Second, macrophage polarization to M1 was associated with a dramatic change in the transcriptome; expression profiles of IPSDM- and HMDM-derived M1 lines were highly correlated with each other but much less so with their respective IPSDM and HMDM precursors. more...

3038. Analysis of the senescent transcriptome upon expression of a ZFP36L1 phosphomutant
(Submitter supplied) We expressed either a wt or a phosphomutant version of ZFP36L1 in IMR90 ER:RAS cells. 7 days upon RAS induction (when the cells reach a fully senescent phenotype) we collected the RNA. ZFP36L1 is a RNA binding protein that binds to AU-rich elements in the 3’UTR of mRNAs and triggers their degradation. Our previous experiments showed that the activity of ZFP36L1 was key in the regulation of the senescent phenotype.By performing RNAseq we have uncovered the effect of expressing a constitutively active mutant of ZFP36L1 within the senescent transcriptome.

While both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 are highly expressed in metastatic melanoma and correlate with decreased patient survival, only H2A.Z.2 deficiency results in impaired cellular proliferation of melanoma cells, which occurs via a G1/S arrest. Integrated gene expression and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that H2A.Z.2 positively regulates E2F target genes, and that such genes acquire a distinct H2A.Z occupancy signature over the promoter and gene body in metastatic melanoma cells. more...

In this work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Gata6 can initiate reprograming of multiple cell types to induced extraembryonic endoderm (iXEN) cells. Intriguingly, Gata6 is sufficient to drive iXEN cells from mouse pluripotent cells and differentiated neural cells. Furthermore, GATA6 induction in human ES (hES) cells also downregulates pluripotency gene expression and upregulates extraembryonic endoderm genes, revealing a conserved function in mediating this cell fate switch. more...

We found that IFN-g regulates macrophage metabolism and translation in an integrated manner by targeting mTORC1 and MNK pathways that converge on the selective regulator of translation initiation eIF4E. Physiological downregulation of the central metabolic regulator mTORC1 by IFN-g was associated with autophagy and translational suppression of repressors of inflammation such as HES1. more...

Current m6A mapping approaches rely on immunoprecipitation of m6A-containing RNA fragments to identify regions of transcripts that contain m6A.  This approach localizes m6A residues to 100-200 nt-long regions of transcripts.  The precise position of m6A in mRNAs cannot be identified on a transcriptome-wide level because there are no chemical methods to distinguish between m6A and adenosine. more...

3086. Dynamics of MBD2 deposition across methylated DNA regions during malignant transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (2)
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation is thought to induce a transcriptional silencing through the combination of two mechanisms: the repulsion of transcriptional activators that do not recognize their binding sites when methylated, and the recruitment of transcriptional repressors that specifically bind methylated DNA. Methyl CpG Binding Domain proteins MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2 belong to the latter category. However, the exact contribution of each protein in the DNA methylation dependent transcriptional repression occurring during development and diseases remains elusive. more...

3089. Acute TNF-induced repression of cell identity genes is mediated by NFkB-directed redistribution of cofactors from super-enhancers
(Submitter supplied) The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a central role in low-grade adipose tissue inflammation and development of insulin resistance during obesity. In this context, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB), is directly involved and required for the acute activation of the inflammatory gene program. Here we show that the major transactivating subunit of NF?B, v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), is also required for acute TNF-induced suppression of adipocyte genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model retains the heterogeneity of patient tumors, allowing a means to not only examine efficacy of a therapy across a population, but also study crucial aspects of cancer biology in response to treatment. Herein we describe the development and characterization of an ovarian-PDX model in order to study the development of chemoresistance. We demonstrate that PDX tumors are not simply composed of tumor-initiating cells, but recapitulate the original tumor’s heterogeneity, oncogene expression profiles, and clinical response to chemotherapy. more...

3092. Regulating Interleukin-2 activity with engineered receptor signaling clamps
(Submitter supplied) Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates lymphocyte function by signaling through heterodimerization of the IL-2Rβ and γc receptor subunits. Previously, we engineered an IL-2 “superkine” (H9) with enhanced affinity for IL-2Rβ. Here, we describe next-generation IL-2 variants that function as “receptor signaling clamps.” They retain high-affinity for IL-2Rβ, thereby inhibiting binding of endogenous IL-2, but their engagement of γc is weakened, thereby attenuating IL-2Rβ-γc heterodimerization. more...

(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal messenger (mRNA) modification in mammalian mRNA. This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric, which potentially adds an additional layer of variety and dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The m6A-modified mRNA can be selectively recognized by the YTH family “reader” proteins. The preferential binding of m6A-containing mRNA by YTHDF2 is known to reduce the stability of the target transcripts; however, the exact effects of m6A on translation has yet to be elucidated. more...

In addition, mapping the 3’ ends of RNA molecules to the genome after high-throughput sequencing is challenging, particularly if the 3’ ends contain posttranscriptional modifications. To address these problems, we developed EnD-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing protocol that preserves the 3’ end of RNA molecules, and AppEnD, a computational method for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated from short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) by Dicer cleavage. Here, we report that siRNA precursors can be divided into two categories with different processing mechanisms and silencing activities that are dependent on stem loop length. We designed an alternative siRNA precursor for triggering RNAi named single-stranded Argonaute2 (Ago2)-processed interfering RNA (saiRNA). more...

3130. Activation of proto-oncogenes by disruption of chromosome neighborhoods [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Mutations such as gene fusion, translocation and focal amplification are a frequent cause of proto-oncogene activation during tumorigenesis, but such mutations do not explain all cases of proto-oncogene activation. Here we show that disruption of local chromosome conformation can also activate proto-oncogenes in human cells. We mapped chromosome structures in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and found that active oncogenes and silent proto-oncogenes generally occur within insulated neighborhoods formed by the looping of two interacting CTCF sites co-occupied by cohesin. more...

ROS can be harmful, due to their damaging effects on several cellular components, but are at the same time essential components of signaling cues. We investigate the effect of OS on the immediate early transcriptional response at a genomic level, by deep sequencing of nuclear and cytosolic RNA fractions, in in human fibroblasts treated for 30 or 120 minutes with sub-lethal doses of H2O2. more...

3141. Transcriptome-wide identification of LARP4B binding sites in HEK293 cells
(Submitter supplied) mRNAs are key molecules in gene expression and subject to diverse regulatory events. Regulation is accomplished by distinct sets of trans-acting factors that interact with mRNAs and form defined mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs). The resulting “mRNP code” determines the fate of any given mRNA and thus controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The La-related protein 4B (LARP4B) belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA binding proteins characterized by the presence of a La-module implicated in direct RNA binding. more...

(Submitter supplied) Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single cell resolution, but what is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for in-depth sequencing, and to do so quantitatively. We have developed a droplet-microfluidic approach for parallel barcoding thousands of individual cells for subsequent RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. This high-throughput method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. more...

3156. Gene target specificity of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) family: How HIV-1 Tat employs selected SEC members to activate viral transcription
(Submitter supplied) The AF4/FMR2 proteins AFF1 and AFF4 act as a scaffold to assemble the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) that strongly activates transcriptional elongation of HIV-1 and cellular genes. Although they can dimerize, it is unclear whether the dimers exist and function within a SEC in vivo. Furthermore, it is unknown whether AFF1 and AFF4 function similarly in mediating SEC-dependent activation of diverse genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNAPII pausing/termination shortly after initiation is a hallmark of gene regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are still to be uncovered. Here, we show that NELF interacts with Integrator complex subunits (INTScom) forming a stable complex with RNPII and Spt5. The interaction between NELF and INTScom subunits is RNA and DNA independent. Using both HIV-1 promoter and genome wide analyses, we demonstrate that Integrator subunits specifically control NELF-mediated RNAPII pause/release at coding genes. more...

3259. Coronary Artery Disease Associated Transcription Factor TCF21 Regulates Smooth Muscle Precursor Cells that Contribute to the Fibrous Cap
(Submitter supplied) Recent genome wide association studies have identified a number of genes that contribute to the risk for coronary heart disease. One such gene, TCF21, encodes a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor believed to serve a critical role in the development of epicardial progenitor cells that give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMC) and cardiac fibroblasts. Using reporter gene and immunolocalization studies with mouse and human tissues we have found that vascular TCF21 expression in the adult is restricted primarily to adventitial cells associated with coronary arteries and also medial SMC in the proximal aorta of mouse. more...

Moreover, we show that patients with PRDM11-deficient diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) have poorer overall survival and belong to the non-Germinal Center B cell (GCB)-like subtype. Mechanistically, genome-wide mapping of PRDM11 binding sites coupled with transcriptome sequencing in human DLBCL cells evidenced that PRDM11 associates with transcriptional start sites of target genes and regulates important oncogenes such as FOS and JUN. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pro-inflammatory response of VSMCs is triggered by endothelial damage and a causative step for thrombosis and neointimal thickening in the arterial vessels. Therefore, we investigate a role of cytosolic Hsp60 as a novel pro-inflammatory mediator in VSMCs.  Hsp60 was detected in the cytosol of VSMCs. The selective depletion of cytosolic Hsp60 in VSMCs reduced the IKK activation, repressed the induction of NF-κB-dependent pro-survival genes (MnSOD and Bfl-1/A1), and enhanced apoptotic death in response to TNF-α. more...

ISRIB renders cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (10.7554/eLife.00498).  Here we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2α and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic process that relies on cellular plasticity; an EMT/MET axis is critical for metastatic colonization of carcinomas. Unlike epithelial programming, regulation of mesenchymal programming is not well understood in EMT. Here we describe the first microRNA that enhances exclusively mesenchymal programming. We demonstrate that microRNA-424 is up-regulated early during a TWIST1/SNAI1-induced EMT, and that it causes cells to express mesenchymal genes without affecting epithelial genes, resulting in a mixed/intermediate EMT. more...

3325. ALS-causative mutations in FUS/TLS confer gain- and loss-of-function by altered association with SMN and U1-snRNP
(Submitter supplied) The RNA-binding protein FUS/TLS, mutation in which is causative of the fatal motor neuron disease ALS, is demonstrated to directly bind to the U1-snRNP and SMN complexes. ALS-causative mutations in FUS/TLS are shown to abnormally enhance their interaction with SMN and reduce interaction with U1-snRNP. Correspondingly, global RNA analysis reveals a mutant-dependent loss of splicing activity, with ALS-linked mutants failing to reverse changes caused by loss of wild-type FUS/TLS. more...

3337. Modeling the early phenotype at the neuromuscular junction of spinal muscular atrophy using patient-derived iPSCs (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. In the pathogenesis of SMA, pathological changes of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) precede the motor neuronal loss. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the NMJ formed by SMA patients’ motor neurons (MNs), and to identify drugs that can restore the normal condition. We generated NMJ-like structures using motor neurons (MNs) derived from SMA patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and found that the clustering of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is significantly impaired. more...

3339. Genetic and drug perturbation of components in the NFkB signaling pathway in 11-18 cells
(Submitter supplied) Through the study of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma we show that NFkB signaling is rapidly engaged by EGFR oncogene inhibition to promote tumor cell persistence and therapy resistance. Unexpectedly, we found that EGFR oncogene inhibition induced an EGFR-TRAF2-RIP1-IKK complex that stimulated an NFkB-mediated transcriptional survival program. We identified a direct pharmacologic NFkB inhibitor, PBS-1086, that suppressed this adaptive survival program and increased both the magnitude and duration of initial EGFR TKI response in cellular and in vivo tumor models, including a novel patient-derived NSCLC xenograft. more...

(Submitter supplied) Whole-exome sequencing studies have implicated chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the identification of de novo loss of function mutations in affected individuals. Many of these genes are co-expressed in mid-fetal human cortex, suggesting ASD risk genes converge in regulatory networks that are perturbed in ASD during neurodevelopment. To elucidate such networks we mapped promoters and enhancers bound by the chromodomain helicase CHD8, which is strongly enriched in ASD-associated de novo loss of function mutations, using ChIP-seq in mid-fetal human brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs), and embryonic mouse cortex. more...

(Submitter supplied) We have compared the proteome, transcriptome and metabolome of two isogenic cell lines: MCF-10A, derived from human breast epithelium, and the mutant MCF-10A-H1047R. These cell lines differ by a single amino acid substitution (H1047R) caused by single nucleotide change in one allele of the PIK3CA gene which encodes the catalytic subunit p110α of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The H1047R mutation of PIK3CA is one of the most frequently encountered somatic cancer-specific mutations. more...

(Submitter supplied) Somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene ZRSR2— located on the X chromosome — are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ZRSR2 is involved in the recognition of 3΄ splice site during the early stages of spliceosome assembly; however, its precise role in RNA splicing has remained unclear. Here, we characterize ZRSR2 as an essential component of the minor spliceosome (U12-dependent) assembly. more...

(Submitter supplied) Most B cell lymphomas arise in the germinal center (GC), where humoral immune responses evolve from potentially oncogenic cycles of mutation, proliferation, and clonal selection. Although lymphoma gene expression diverges significantly from GC-B cells, underlying mechanisms that alter the activities of corresponding regulatory elements (REs) remain elusive. Here we define the complete pathogenic circuitry of human follicular lymphoma (FL), which activates or decommissions transcriptional circuits from normal GC-B cells and commandeers enhancers from other lineages. more...

3368. Type I interferon regulates the expression of long non-coding RNAs [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Interferons (IFNs) are key players in the antiviral response. IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). more...

Most research has focused on inducible gene-expression networks promoting the acquisition of new functions, such as cytokine production and enhanced T-cell-stimulatory capacity. In contrast, mechanisms that modulate DC-function by inducing gene silencing remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel primary epigenetic-silencing response that makes major contributions to the DC-maturation process. more...

3403. The Sweden Canceromics Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) Initiative: a large-scale multicenter infrastructure towards implementation of breast cancer genomic analyses in the clinical routine [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Breast cancer exhibits significant molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Current clinicopathological evaluation is imperfect for predicting outcome, which results in overtreatment for many patients, and for others, leads to death from recurrent disease. Therefore, additional criteria are needed to better personalize care and maximize treatment effectiveness and survival. To address these challenges, the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) consortium was initiated in 2010 as a multicenter prospective study with longsighted aims to 1) analyze breast cancers with next-generation genomic technologies for translational research in a population-based manner and integrated with healthcare; 2) decipher fundamental tumor biology from these analyses; 3) utilize genomic data to develop and validate new clinically-actionable biomarker assays; and 4) build the infrastructure for real-time clinical implementation of molecular diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tests. more...

3429. 7q11.23 dosage-dependent dysregulation in the human pluripotent state primes aberrant transcriptional programs in disease-relevant lineages (RNAseq)
(Submitter supplied) We apply the cellular reprogramming experimental paradigm to two disorders caused by symmetrical copy number variations (CNV) of 7q11.23 and displaying a striking combination of shared as well as symmetrically opposite phenotypes: Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) and 7q microduplication syndrome (7dupASD). Through a uniquely large and informative cohort of transgene-free patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), along with their differentiated derivatives, we find that 7q11.23 CNV disrupt transcriptional circuits in disease-relevant pathways already at the pluripotent state. more...

3435. Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Has Dual Functions as a Major Regulator of Androgen Receptor Transcriptional Activity
(Submitter supplied) Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1, KDM1A) functions as a transcriptional corepressor through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), but has coactivator function on some genes through unclear mechanisms. We show that LSD1, interacting with CoREST, associates with and coactivates androgen receptor (AR) on a large fraction of androgen-stimulated genes. A subset of these AR/LSD1-associated enhancer sites have histone 3 threonine 6 phosphorylation (H3T6ph), and these sites are further enriched for androgen-stimulated genes. more...

Here we identify TUT4 and TUT7 (also known as ZCCHC11 and ZCCHC6, respectively) as the enzymes that uridylate mRNAs. Uridylation readily occurs on deadenylated mRNAs that are not associated with poly(A) binding protein (PABPC1) in cells. Consistently, purified TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) selectively uridylate RNAs with short A tails (< ~25 nt) while PABPC1 antagonizes uridylation of polyadenylated mRNAs in vitro. more...

3496. An Endotoxin Tolerance Signature Predicts Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction at Initial Clinical Presentation
(Submitter supplied) Background: Sepsis involves aberrant immune responses to infection, but the exact nature of this immune dysfunction remains poorly defined. Bacterial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are potent inducers of inflammation, which has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis, but repeated exposure can also induce a suppressive effect known as endotoxin tolerance or cellular reprogramming. more...

(Submitter supplied) Changes in gene regulation level have long been thought to play an important role in evolution and speciation, especially in primates. Over the past decade, comparative genomic studies have revealed extensive inter-species differences in gene expression levels yet we know much less about the extent to which regulatory mechanisms differ between species. To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative epigenetic study in primate lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), to query the contribution of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and four histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) to inter-species variation in gene expression levels. more...

(Submitter supplied) Gene expression microarray has been the primary biomarker platform ubiquitously applied in biomedical research, resulting in enormous data, predictive models and biomarkers accrued. Recently, RNA-seq has looked likely to replace microarrays, but there will be a period where both technologies coexist. This raises two important questions: can microarray-based models and biomarkers be directly applied to RNA-Seq data? Can future RNA-Seq-based predictive models and biomarkers be applied to microarray data to leverage past investment? We systematically evaluated the transferability of predictive models and signature genes between microarray and RNA-seq using two large clinical data sets. more...

3550. Tumor cell-specific inhibition of MYC function using small molecule inhibitors of the HUWE1 ubiquitin ligase
(Submitter supplied) Deregulated expression of MYC is a driver of colorectal carcinogenesis, necessitating novel strategies to inhibit MYC function. The ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 (HECTH9, ARFBP1,  MULE) associates with both MYC and the MYC-associated protein MIZ1. We show here that HUWE1 is required for growth of colorectal cancer cells in culture and in orthotopic xenograft models. Using high throughput screening, we identify small  molecule inhibitors of HUWE1, which inhibit MYC-dependent transactivation in colorectal cancer cells, but not in stem and normal colon epithelial cells. more...

3551. Transcriptome-wide ribonuclease footprinting to identify RNA-protein interaction sites
(Submitter supplied) RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are intimately involved in all aspects of RNA processing and regulation and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Therefore, understanding the relationship between RBPs and their RNA targets is critical for a broader understanding of post-transcriptional regulation in normal and disease processes.  The majority of approaches to study RNA-protein interactions focus on single RBPs, however there are many hundreds RBPs encoded in the human genome, and each cell type expresses a different catalog of these regulatory molecules, greatly limiting the ability of these single RBP approaches to capture the global landscape of RNA-protein interactions. more...

(Submitter supplied) The U2AF heterodimer has been well studied for its role in defining functional 3’ splice sites in pre-mRNA splicing, but many fundamental questions still remain unaddressed regarding the function of U2AF in mammalian genomes. Through genome-wide analysis of U2AF-RNA interactions, we report that U2AF has the capacity to directly define ~88% of functional 3’ splice sites in the human genome, but numerous U2AF binding events also occur in intronic locations. more...

3567. Charaterization of genetic alterations and gene expression signatures found in BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant KCL-22 subpopulations and single clones
(Submitter supplied) KCL-22 is a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line derived from a patient in blast crisis phase and harbors the BCR-ABL translocation. The catalytic (ATP-competitive) BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib have dramatically improved CML patient outcome, but the development of resistance remains a clinical challenge. The recent identification of allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as GNF-2, which target the enzyme by binding to the myristoyl pocket rather than catalytic site of ABL1, may provide a strategy to broadly overcome resistance to the class of ABL1 ATP competitive inhibitors. more...

Cleavage of H3 tail occurs at two distinct residues and is mediated by Cathepsin L. We show that variant H3.3 is preferentially cleaved, and that cleaved histones are associated with chromatin and incorporated into nucleosomes.  We also found that the histone chaperone ASF1a is required for chromatin incorporation of the cleaved histone species. more...

3596. The systematic shortening of 3’ UTRs has limited influence on the relative change in protein abundance in proliferating cells
(Submitter supplied) Alternative polyadenylation is an important cellular mechanism that enables generation of  mRNA isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and consequently in their susceptibility to miRNA and RNA binding protein mediated regulation. A dramatic change in polyadenylation site usage, leading to the systematic expression of short 3’ UTR isoforms is known to occur upon induction of proliferation in resting cells. more...

3597. Epigenetic Repogramming by an Environmental Carcinogen Through Chromatin Domain Disruption
(Submitter supplied) This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.  Histone modifications associated with gene silencing typically mark large contiguous regions of the genome forming repressive chromatin domain structures. Since the repressive domains exist in close proximity to active regions, maintenance of domain structure is critically important. This study shows that nickel, a nonmutagenic carcinogen, can disrupt histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) domain structures genome-wide, resulting in spreading of H3K9me2 marks into the active regions, which is associated with gene silencing. more...

Here we use digital footprinting and ChIP-sequencing to identify the core RUNX1/ETO responsive transcriptional network of t(8;21) cells. We show that the transcriptional programme underlying leukemic propagation is regulated by a dynamic equilibrium between RUNX1/ETO and RUNX1 complexes, which bind in a mutually exclusive fashion to identical genomic sites. more...

3600. U2AF1 mutations alter splice site recognition in hematological malignancies
(Submitter supplied) Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3' splice site recognition factor U2AF1 altered its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. more...

3602. The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression
(Submitter supplied) Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. The median survival of this group of patients after diagnosis is ∼1 yr. Here we show that the levels of H3K27 di- and trimethylation (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) are reduced globally in H3.3K27M patient samples due to the expression of the H3.3K27M mutant allele. more...

3603. Low MITF/AXL ratio predicts early resistance to multiple targeted drugs in melanoma
(Submitter supplied) Increased MITF expression contributes to melanoma progression and resistance to BRAF pathway inhibition. We show that, unexpectedly, lack of MITF is associated with more severe resistance to a range of inhibitors. Indeed, the presence of endogenous MITF was essential for robust drug responses. Both in primary and acquired resistance, MITF levels inversely correlated with expression of several activated receptor tyrosine kinases, most commonly AXL. more...

Therefore, identification of m6A readers is especially important in determining the cellular function of m6A. YTHDF2 has recently been characterized as the first m6A reader that regulates the cytoplasmic stability of methylated RNA. Here we show that YTHDC1 is a nuclear m6A reader and report the crystal structure of the YTH domain of YTHDC1 bound to m6A-containing RNA. more...

3609. RNA-seq from control and macroH2A1-depleted IMR90 primary human lung fibroblasts
(Submitter supplied) The histone variant macroH2A1 and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP-1 both regulate gene transcription by modulating chromatin structure and function. Of the two macroH2A1 splice variants, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, the former is often suppressed in cancer and has the unique ability to interact with poly(ADP-ribose). Using ChIP-seq in primary lung fibroblasts, we demonstrate that macroH2A1 is incorporated into either of two spatially and functionally distinct types of chromatin; the first is marked by H3 K27 trimethylation, while the second contains a set of nine histone acetylations. more...

3630. A histone H3.3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation Reader Connects Chromatin to Regulated Pre-mRNA Processing
(Submitter supplied) BS69 (aka ZMYND11) was initially discovered as a direct target of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein1. Subsequent studies implicated BS69 as a tumor suppressor and a transcriptional regulator2. But exactly how BS69 regulates gene expression has remained elusive. BS69 contains tandemly arranged PHD, BROMO and PWWP domains, which are known to function as chromatin recognition modalities. Here we show that BS69 selectively recognizes histone variant H3.3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3.3K36me3) via these chromatin recognition modules. more...

(Submitter supplied) Rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics is the first-line therapy for variety of lymphoproliferative disorders including low- and high grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL). Although the complete response rate is quite impressive, vast majority of patient presents recurrent disease. The association between CD20 expression and clinical outcome in patients strongly suggests that reduced CD20 expression leads to inferior response to RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone). more...

3644. Ribosome Profiling Reveals Pervasive Translation Outside of Annotated Protein-Coding Genes
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome profiling suggests that ribosomes occupy many regions of the transcriptome thought to be non-coding, including 5' UTRs and lncRNAs. Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. more...

3648. mRNA expression in HEK-293 /STF cells
(Submitter supplied) Canonical Wnt signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) is required for vascularization of the central nervous system (CNS) and for formation and maintenance of barrier properties unique to CNS vasculature. Gpr124 is an orphan member of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family that is expressed in ECs and is essential for CNS angiogenesis and barrier formation via an unknown mechanism. Using canonical Wnt signaling assays in cell culture and genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice, we show that Gpr124 functions as a co-activator of Wnt7a- and Wnt7b-stimulated canonical Wnt signaling via a Frizzled receptor and Lrp co-receptor, and that Gpr124-stimulated signaling functions in concert with Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling to control CNS vascular development. more...

(Submitter supplied) Mpn1 proteins are evolutionarily conserved exonucleases that modify spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) post-transcriptionally. Mutations in the human MPN1 gene are associated to the genodermatosis Clericuzio-type poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN). Mpn1 deficiency leads to aberrant U6 3’ end processing and accelerated U6 decay through unknown molecular mechanisms. Here we show that in mpn1Δ fission yeast cells U6 is barely bound by the protective Lsm2-8 complex, undergoes extensive oligoadenylation and is degraded by the nuclear RNA exonuclease Rrp6 independently of the poly(A) polymerase Cid14/Trf4. more...

(Submitter supplied) SOX11 (Sex determining region Y-box 11) expression is specific for MCL as compared to other Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. However, the function and direct binding targets of SOX11 in MCL are largely unknown. We used high-resolution ChIP-Seq to identify the direct target genes of SOX11 in a genome-wide, unbiased manner and elucidate its functional significance. Pathway analysis identified WNT, PKA and TGF-beta signaling pathways as significantly enriched by SOX11 target genes. more...

3669. UBL5 is essential for pre-mRNA splicing and sister chromatid cohesion in human cells
(Submitter supplied) UBL5 is an atypical ubiquitin-like protein, whose function in metazoans remains largely unexplored. We show that UBL5 is required for sister chromatid cohesion maintenance in human cells. UBL5 primarily associates with spliceosomal proteins, and UBL5 depletion decreases pre-mRNA splicing efficiency, leading to globally enhanced intron retention. Defective sister chromatid cohesion is a general consequence of dysfunctional pre-mRNA splicing, resulting from the selective downregulation of the cohesion protection factor Sororin. more...

3671. RNA-sequencing analysis of glucose and acetate regulated transcripts in glioblastoma cells
(Submitter supplied) Our studies indicate that glucose and acetate can regulate histone acetylation by altering the acetyl-CoA concentrations in the cell. The purpose of this study was to to determine whether specific gene sets correlated with acetyl-CoA availability. We conclude that 10% of glucose-regulated genes are acetyl-CoA regulated genes (genes suppressed or induced by low glucose and reversed by acetate). Acetate usually regulated gene expression in the same direction as glucose, suggesting that acetyl-CoA is a key mediator of glucose-dependent gene expression.

3696. Transcriptomic profiling of HeLa cells treated with miR-15a, miR-16, miR-503 and control-miR
(Submitter supplied) To have a global picture of the targets of the miR-15 family, we assessed transcriptome changes, by deep-sequencing, of HeLa cells transfected with 3 members of the miR-15 family (miR-15a, miR-16 or miR-503) or a control miRNA (cel-miR-231). We observed a very extensive overlap between the genes down-regulated by these 3 miRNAs, as expected for miRNAs belonging to the same family.

3712. Investigation into human Tra2 protein-dependent splicing in MDA-MB-231 cells using iCLIP and RNA-seq
(Submitter supplied) Alternative splicing—the production of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene—is regulated in part by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). While the RBPs Tra2α and Tra2β have both been implicated in the regulation of alternative splicing, their relative contribution to this process are not well understood. Here we use iCLIP to identify Tra2β target exons in MDA-MB-231 cells. We find that simultaneous—but not individual—depletion of Tra2α and Tra2β induces substantial shifts in the splicing pattern of endogenous Tra2β target exons identified by iCLIP. more...

3720. Bromodomain protein BRD4 is required for estrogen receptor-dependent transcription and enhancer activation [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) The estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is a transcription factor which plays a critical role in controlling cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by recruiting various cofactors to estrogen response elements (EREs) to induce or repress gene transcription. A deeper understanding of these transcriptional mechanisms may uncover novel therapeutic targets for ERα-dependent cancers.

3729. Gene expression (RNA-Seq) analysis of primary human T cells reveals novel genes associated with Th2 memory differentiation and asthma susceptibility
(Submitter supplied) A characteristic feature of asthma is the aberrant accumulation, differentiation or function of memory CD4+ T cells that produce Th2 cytokines (Th2 cells). By comparing gene expression profiles of T cell subsets isolated from peripheral blood of healthy and asthmatic individuals, we identified genes with known and potential roles in the normal differentiation of human Th1 and Th2 cells.

3732. Genome wide profiling of MBD2 binding
(Submitter supplied) We show that in vivo MBD2 is mainly recruited to CpG island promoters that are highly methylated. We also report that MBD2 binds to a subset of CpG island promoters that are characterized by the presence of active histone marks and RNA polymerase II (Pol2). At such sites, MBD2 binds downstream of the transcription start site. Active promoters bound by MBD2 show low to medium gene expression levels and H3K36me3 deposition suggesting a putative role for MBD2 in blocking polymerase II (Pol2) elongation at these promoters.

SAMHD1 has been shown to possess a dGTP-dependent dNTP triphosphatase (dNTPase) activity and is proposed to inhibit HIV-1 replication by depleting the intracellular dNTP pool. Arguing against a role for SAMHD1 dNTPase in HIV-1 restriction, the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 regulates the restriction activity toward HIV-1 without affecting its ability to decrease cellular dNTP levels. more...

(Submitter supplied) To systematically investigate early host transcriptional response to HIV-1 infection, including polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts, we separately sequenced Total RNAs (Total RNA-seq) from HIV-1-infected SupT1 cells, a human CD4+ T cell line. We show many non-polyadenylated RNAs were also differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, as expected only detected by Total RNA-seq. Interestingly, we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 hour post-infection by Total RNA-seq than by mRNA-seq, mostly protein-coding genes.

(Submitter supplied) We report that full length TET1 (TET1-FL) overexpression fails to induce global DNA demethylation in HEK293T cells. The preferential binding of TET1-FL to hypomethylated CpG islands (CGIs) through its CXXC domain leads to its inhibited 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) production as methylation level increases. TET1-FL-induced 5hmC accumulates at CGI edges, while TET1 knockdown induces methylation spreading from methylated edges into hypomethylated CGIs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumor metastasis remains the major cause of cancer-related death, but its molecular basis is still not well understood. Here we uncovered a splicing-mediated pathway that is essential for breast cancer metastasis. We show that the RNA-binding protein hnRNPM promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating the switch of alternative splicing that occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Genome-wide deep sequencing analysis suggests that hnRNPM potentiates TGFb signaling and identifies CD44 as a key downstream target of hnRNPM. more...

3803. Global analysis of the nuclear processing of unspliced U12-type introns by the exosome
(Submitter supplied) we analyzed globally the effect of exosome processing on the nuclear pre-mRNA transcripts by inactivating either the RRP41 or DIS3 subunit of the exosome. Using SOLiD RNA sequencing technology, we report 30-120 million mapped cellular compartment specific reads per sample allowing the detection of unspliced pre-mRNAs. We show that RRP41 and DIS3 knockdowns stabilize an overlapping set of U12-type introns.

(Submitter supplied) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed 31 novel lncRNAs in HCASMC, including a vascular cell-enriched lncRNA called SENCR (for Smooth muscle and Endothelial cell long Non-Coding RNA). RT-PCR and hybridization studies show SENCR exists in two isoforms and is transcribed antisense from the 5’ end of the FLI1 gene. Knockdown of SENCR has no effect on FLI1 mRNA or protein expression. Biochemical fractionation and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies indicate SENCR is a cytoplasmic lncRNA. more...

(Submitter supplied) The development of affinity purification technologies together with mass spectrometric analyses of the purified protein mixtures (AP-MS) has been used both to identify new protein-protein interactions and to define the subunit composition of protein complexes. Transcription factor protein interactions, however, have not been systematically analyzed using these approaches. Here, we have investigated whether ectopic expression of an affinity tagged transcription factor as bait in AP-MS experiments perturbs gene expression in cells resulting in false positive identification of bait associated proteins when typical experimental controls are used. more...

(Submitter supplied) Genetically engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been proposed as a source for transplantation therapies and are rapidly becoming valuable tools for human disease modeling. However, many of the potential applications are still limited by the lack of robust differentiation paradigms that allow for the isolation of defined functional tissues. These challenges could be overcome by the use of adult tissue stem cells derived from hPSCs, as their restricted potential could limit the differentiation towards other undesired linages, and allow in vitro expansion and long- term propagation of fully differentiated tissue. more...

Although the cytoplasmic function of Dicer is well documented in mammals, there is little known about any possible nuclear function.  Here we show that Dicer is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but that its nuclear levels are tightly regulated. In its nuclear manifestation Dicer interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at actively-transcribed gene loci. more...

(Submitter supplied) The tumorigenesis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is poorly understood. Recent studies have associated alternative polyadenylation with proliferation, cell transformation and cancer. Polyadenylation is the process in which the pre-mRNA is cleaved at a polyA site and a polyA tail is added. Genes with two or more polyA sites can undergo alternative polyadenylation. This produces two or more distinct mRNA isoforms with different 3’ untranslated regions. more...

3870. Next-generation sequencing facilitates quantitative analysis of AcKLF5 and unAcKLF5 transcriptomes in xenografts of DU-145 cell line
(Submitter supplied) KLF5 possesses both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities, though the mechanism controlling these opposing functions is unknown. In cultured non-cancerous epithelial cells, KLF5 converts from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative activity upon TGFβ-induced acetylation, which sequentially alters the KLF5 transcriptional complex and the expression of genes such as p15 and MYC. In nude mice, KLF5 also suppressed tumor growth in an acetylation-dependent manner. more...

3873. The age and genomic integrity of neurons after cortical stroke in humans
(Submitter supplied) It has been unclear whether ischemic stroke induces neurogenesis or neuronal DNA-rearrangements in the human neocortex. We show here that neither is the case, using immunohistochemistry, transcriptome-, genome- and ploidy-analyses, and determination of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C-concentration in neuronal DNA. A large proportion of cortical neurons display DNA-fragmentation and DNA-repair short time after stroke, whereas neurons at chronic stages after stroke show DNA-integrity, demonstrating the relevance of an intact genome for survival.

Using this strategy, we identified two types of oligouridylated degradation intermediates: RNAs ending at different sites of the 3' side of the stemloop that resulted from initial degradation by 3'hExo and intermediates near the stop codon and within the coding region. We established a method for identifying degradation intermediates for replication-depdendent histone mRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are regarded as a central tool to understand human biology in health and disease. Similarly, iPSCs from closely related species should be a central tool to understand human evolution and to identify conserved and variable patterns of iPSC disease models. Here, we have generated human, gorilla, bonobo and cynomolgus monkey iPSCs. We show that these cells are well comparable in their differentiation potential and generally similar to human, cynomolgus and rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs). more...

3914. Extensive Evolutionary Changes in Regulatory Element Activity during Human Origins Are Associated with Altered Gene Expression and Positive Selection [DGE-seq]
(Submitter supplied) The human genome shares a remarkable amount of genomic sequence with our closest living primate relatives. Researchers have long sought to understand what regions of the genome are responsible for unique species-specific traits. Previous studies have shown that many genes are differentially expressed between species, but the regulatory elements contributing to these differences are largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide comparison of active gene regulatory elements in human, chimpanzee, and macaque, and we identify hundreds of regulatory elements that have been gained or lost in the human or chimpanzee genomes since their evolutionary divergence. These elements contain evidence of natural selection and correlate with species-specific changes in gene expression. Polymorphic DNA bases in transcription factor motifs that we found in these regulatory elements may be responsible for the varied biological functions across species. This study directly links phenotypic and transcriptional differences between species with changes in chromatin structure.

3915. Genome-wide maps of WT and over-expressing CenH3/CENP-A in Human HeLa S3 cells
(Submitter supplied) Centromeres are essential to ensure proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. Their definition relies on the presence of a centromere-specific H3 histone variant CenH3, known as CENP-A in mammals. Its overexpression in aggressive cancers raises questions concerning its effect on chromatin dynamics and contribution to tumorigenesis. We find that CenH3 overexpression in human cells leads to ectopic enrichment at sites of active histone turnover. more...

Tamoxifen resistance may be the result of the acquisition of epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation within breast cancer cells resulting in changed mRNA expression of genes being pivotal for estrogen dependent growth. Alternatively, tamoxifen resistance may be due to selection of preexisting resistant cells, which may exhibit cancer stem-like characteristics or a combination of the two mechanisms. more...

3936. WTAP is a novel oncogenic protein in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
(Submitter supplied) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have the lowest survival rates of all leukemias. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes for AML patients. Here, we report a novel role for Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) in pathogenesis of AML. We have performed RNA-Seq in K562 cells with knockdown of WTAP to ascertain which genes it regulates.

3970. Regulation of NUMB alternative splicing by RBM5, RBM6 and RBM10 controls cancer cell proliferation (CLIP-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) RBM5, a regulator of alternative splicing of apoptotic genes, and its close homologues, RBM6 and RBM10, are RNA binding proteins frequently deleted or mutated in lung cancer. We report that RBM5/6 and RBM10 antagonistically regulate the proliferative capacity of cancer cells and display distinct positional effects in alternative splicing regulation. We identify the Notch pathway regulator NUMB as a key target of these factors in the control of cell proliferation. more...

4000. m6A-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability
(Submitter supplied) N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in the mRNA of all higher eukaryotes. Here we present that m6A is selectively recognized by human YTH domain family (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. By using crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we have identified over 4000 substrate RNA of YTHDF2 with conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further estabilshed the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism by a combination of ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, m6A level quantification and cell-based imaging: the C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A of mRNA and the N-terminal domain is responsive for localizing mRNA from translatable pool to processing body where mRNA decay occurs.

(Submitter supplied) Unraveling complex signaling programs animating developmental lineage-decisions is pivotal to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into pure populations of desired lineages for regenerative medicine. Developmental signals are strikingly temporally dynamic: BMP and Wnt initially specify primitive streak (progenitor to endoderm) yet 24 hours later suppress endoderm and induce mesoderm. At lineage bifurcations we show mutually-exclusive embryonic lineages are segregated through cross-repressive signals: TGFβ and BMP/MAPK duel to respectively specify pancreas versus liver from endoderm. more...

4037. Long Noncoding RNA HNF1A-AS1 Regulates Proliferation and Migration in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma  Cells
(Submitter supplied) Objectives: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in the development and progression of cancer. However, functional lncRNAs and their downstream mechanisms are largely unknown in the molecular pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its progression. Design: lncRNAs that are abnormally upregulated in EACs were identified by RNA-seq analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) validation using tissues from 31 EAC patients. more...

4038. Genome-wide Analysis of Chromatin Interactions in Human Cells
(Submitter supplied) Millions of cis-regulatory sequences have recently been found in the human genome, but the function of most cis-elements are not yet clear, in part due to the difficulty in determining their regulatory targets, which are often located millions of base pairs away and separated by one or more unrelated genes. To address this problem, the Hi-C method has been developed to identify long-range looping interactions in a genome-wide, unbiased fashion. more...

4043. Primate transcript and protein expression levels evolve under compensatory selection pressures
(Submitter supplied) Variation in gene regulation is thought to have played an important role in the evolution of primates, and many studies have documented differences in mRNA expression levels across primate species. However, it is not yet known to what extent measurements of divergence in mRNA levels reflect divergence in protein expression levels, which are more directly tied to phenotypic differences. To address this question, we used high-resolution, quantitative mass spectrometry to collect thousands of protein expression measurements from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). more...

4046. Synthetic cationic peptide IDR-1018 modulates human macrophage differentiation
(Submitter supplied) Synthetic, innate defense regulators (IDR) peptides, designed based on natural host defenses peptides, have enhanced immunomodulatory activities and reduced toxicity leading to protection in infection and inflammation models that is dependent on macrophages/monocytes. Here we measured the effect of IDR-1018 on macrophage gene expression during differentiation. Differentiation in the presence of IDR-1018 induced a unique signature of immune responses suggesting that IDR-1018 drives macrophage differentiation towards an intermediate M1-M2 state, enhancing anti-inflammatory functions while maintaining certain pro-inflammatory activities important to the resolution of infection.

(Submitter supplied) The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is normally expressed at high levels in germ cells of the testis. When aberrantly expressed in muscle its protein product causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), perhaps partly by inducing inappropriate expression of germline genes. DUX4 can bind >60,000 locations in the human genome that contain a strongly enriched sequence motif. Numerous long terminal repeat (LTR) class repetitive elements are enriched among DUX4 binding sites, including many from the mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposon (MaLR) family as well as some ERVL and ERVK types, with MaLRs comprising ~1/3 of DUX4’s binding sites. more...

4071. A compendium of hematopoietic regulators, chromatin modifiers and basal transcription factors occupy CBF-MYH11/RUNX1 target genes
(Submitter supplied) Different mechanisms for CBF-MYH11 function in acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBF-MYH11 binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics we found that CBF-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the co regulators EP300 and HDAC1. more...

4072. Non-IG Aberrations of FOXP1 in B-Cell Malignancies Lead to an Aberrant Expression of N-Truncated Isoforms of FOXP1
(Submitter supplied) The transcription factor FOXP1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas through immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus-related chromosomal translocations leading to dysregulated expression of FOXP1. Translocations of FOXP1 with non-IG gene sequences have been also reported, but the molecular consequences of such aberrations remain undetermined. Here, using molecular cytogenetics and molecular biology studies, we comprehensively analyzed four lymphoma cases with non-IG rearrangements of FOXP1 and compared these with cases harboring t(3;14)(p13;q32)/IGH-FOXP1 and FOXP1-expressing lymphomas without underlying t(3p13/FOXP1). more...

4073. Global analysis of alternative splicing regulated by RBM10
(Submitter supplied) RBM10 is an RNA binding protein that was identified as a component of spliceosome complex, suggesting its potential role in splicing regulation. However, the direct experimental evidence for this function has been lacking. Here we characterized in vivo RBM10-RNA interactions and investigated the role of RBM10 in splicing regulation at the global level. We observed significant RBM10-RNA interactions in the vicinity of splice sites and identified hundreds of splicing changes following perturbation of cellular RBM10 abundance. more...

4080. Co-ordinate inhibition of autism candidate genes by topoisomerase inhibitors [Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Topoisomerases are necessary for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, and are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have studied the effects of inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) enzymes on mouse cortical neurons. We find that topoisomerases selectively inhibit long genes (>100kb), with little effect on all other gene expression. Using ChIPseq against RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) we show that the Top1 inhibitor topotecan blocks transcriptional elongation of long genes specifically. more...

4109. Unprecedented alternative splicing and 3 Mb of novel transcribed sequence leads to significant transcript diversity in the transcriptome of the human retina
(Submitter supplied) The mRNA repertoire is specific to a given tissue type.  This specificity, whether it is in the levels of gene expression or the splicing pattern of the transcripts, is important to study to increase our general knowledge of transcription and alternative splicing, as well as to identify novel coding sequence that can be important for elucidating the mechanisms of disease.  We have performed RNA-Seq on three normal human retinal samples and have found a profound level of novel alternative splicing including novel exons, exon skipping, and 3’ and 5’ alternate splice sites. more...

(Submitter supplied) Posttranslational histone modifications play important roles in regulating chromatin structure and function. Histone H2B ubiquitination and deubiquitination have been implicated in transcriptional regulation, but the function of H2B deubiquitination is not well defined, particularly in higher eukaryotes. Here we report the purification of USP49 as a histone H2B specific deubiquitinase and demonstrate that H2B deubiquitination by USP49 is required for efficient co-transcriptional splicing of a large set of exons. more...

(Submitter supplied) Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency have largely focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non- coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing (AS) represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in the regulation of ESC pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we identify the Muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of AS events that are differentially regulated between ESCs and other cell types. more...

4141. A Stable Transcription Factor Complex Nucleated by Dimeric AML1-ETO Controls Leukaemogenesis
(Submitter supplied) AML1-ETO, a fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, is a transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation. We now show that, in leukemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable protein complex (AETFC) that contains several hematopoietic transcription factors and cofactors. In conjunction with biochemical and leukemia pathological studies, the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of the AETFC components in leukemic cells reveal that these components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, colocalize genome-wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukemogenesis.

4144. Global regulation of alternative splicing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Alternative mRNA splicing is a major mechanism for gene regulation and transcriptome diversity. Despite the extent of the phenomenon, the regulation and specificity of the splicing machinery are only partially understood. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing of pre-mRNA by ADAR enzymes has been linked to splicing regulation in several cases. Here we used bioinformatics approaches, RNA-seq and exon-specific microarray of ADAR knockdown cells to globally examine how ADAR and its A-to-I RNA editing activity influence alternative mRNA splicing. more...

In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs referred to as eRNAs are present on enhancers. However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional, or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Here, we report that 17 β-estradiol (E2)-bound estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) on enhancers causes a global increase in eRNA transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2 upregulated coding genes. more...

The functional relevance of these RNAs is largely unknown. To gain insight into the complexity of snoRNA processing and the functional relevance of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, we sequenced long and short RNAs, small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 protein and RNA fragments obtained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins. more...

4184. Comparing proteomics and RISC immunoprecipitations to identify targets of Epstein-Barr viral miRNAs [RISC-IP-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Epstein-Barr virus is a gamma-herpes virus that is causally associated with several lymphomas and carcinomas. This virus encodes at least 25 pre-miRNAs, which are expressed in infected cells to yield more than 50 detected mature miRNAs. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression by promoting the inhibition of translation or of degradation of mRNAs. Currently, the function of these viral miRNAs and the contribution they provide to EBV's life-cycle remain largely unknown, due to difficulties in identifying cellular and viral genes regulated by these miRNAs. more...

4211. Amplitude modulation of androgen signaling by c-MYC [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Androgen-stimulated growth of the molecular apocrine breast cancer is mediated by an androgen receptor (AR)-regulated transcriptional program.  Through profiling the genomic licalizations of AR and its co-regulators FOXA1 and TCF7L2 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, we revealed the molecular details of the AR-centered regulatory network. We further identified that  c-MYC is a key downstream target co-regulated by AR, FOXA1 and TCF7L2, and reinforces the transctiopnal activation of androgen-responsive genes in this subtype of breast cancers.

In this experiment we measured the amount of transcription occurring in HCT116 colon cancer cells, regardless of degradation, using GRO-seq (global nuclear run-on sequencing). This information demonstrates that many genes have a pile-up of transcriptionally-engaged polymerase near their 5'-end.

4243. Identification of Novel Molecular Markers through Transcriptomic Analysis in Human Fetal and Adult Corneal Endothelial Cells
(Submitter supplied) Corneal endothelium is composed of a monolayer of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) in the inner layer of cornea, which is essential for maintaining corneal transparency. In order to better characterize CECs in different developmental stages, we profiled mRNA transcriptomes in human fetal and adult corneal endothelium with the goal to identify novel molecular markers in these cells. By comparing CECs with 12 other types of tissues, we identified 245 and 284 signature genes that are highly expressed in fetal and adult CECs, respectively. more...

4247. A global analysis of tandem 3'UTRs in eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps
(Submitter supplied) Background: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as a widespread mechanism of gene regulation. The usage of APA sites allows a single gene to encode multiple mRNA transcripts with different 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) lengths. Many disease processes reflect the importance of the regulation of APA site switching. The objective of this study was to explore the profiling of tandem APA sites in nasal polyps compared with nasal uncinate process mucosa. more...

4251. Candida albicans induces monocyte training via epigenetic programming through a dectin 1-dependent pathway
(Submitter supplied) Non-specific protective effects against reinfection have been described following infection with Candida albicans. Here we show that mice defective in functional T and B lymphocytes were protected against reinfection with C. albicans in a monocyte-dependent manner. C. albicans and beta glucans induced functional programming of monocytes, leading to enhanced cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. The training required the beta glucan receptor dectin 1 and the non-canonical Raf 1 pathway. Monocyte training by beta-glucans was mediated by epigenetic mechanisms through genome-wide changes in histone trimethylation at H3K4. Pathway analysis showed specific induction of epigenetic changes in genes of innate immunity. The functional programming of monocytes, reminiscent of similar properties of NK cells, has been termed “trained immunity” and may be employed for the design of improved vaccination strategies.

(Submitter supplied) We assessed whether human transcripts expressed in an aneuploid mouse that carries human chromosome 21 (HsChr21) are spliced in a human-specific or mouse-specific fashion. In almost all cases, human-specific alternative splicing is maintained in the mouse nucleus. Species-specific splicing therefore appears to be primarily directed by cis-acting elements, rather than changes in the levels or activities of trans-acting factors.

4278. Histone acetylation regulates intracellular pH
(Submitter supplied) Differences in global levels of histone acetylation occur in normal and cancer cells, although the reason cells regulate these levels has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate a role for histone acetylation in regulating intracellular pH (pHi). As pHi decreases, histones are globally deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the released acetate anions are co-exported with protons out of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), preventing further reductions in pHi. more...

(Submitter supplied) Reprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has been suspected of causing de novo copy number variations (CNVs). To explore this issue, we performed a whole-genome and transcriptome analysis of 20 human iPSC lines derived from primary skin fibroblasts of 7 individuals using next-generation sequencing. We find that, on average, an iPSC line manifests two CNVs not apparent in the fibroblasts from which the iPSC was derived. more...

4280. Efficient direct reprogramming of c-Kit− mature amniotic cells into endothelial cells by ETS factors and TGFβ suppression
(Submitter supplied) ETS transcription factors ETV2, FLI1 and ERG1 specify pluripotent stem cells into endothelial cells (PSC-ECs). However, these PSC-ECs are unstable and often drift towards non-vascular cell fates. We show that human mid-gestation c-Kit- lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into induced vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs). Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generated immature iVECs, while co-expression with FLI1/ERG1 endowed rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature ECs. more...

(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotes, the 3' ends of RNA polymerase II-generated transcripts are made in the majority of cases by site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail. By alternative polyadenylation, a gene can give rise to multiple mRNA isoforms that differ in the length of their 3' UTRs and hence in their susceptibility to post-transcriptional regulatory factors such as microRNAs. more...

4284. Revisiting Global Gene Expression Analysis (RNA-Seq)
(Submitter supplied) Gene expression analysis is a widely used and powerful method for investigating the transcriptional behavior of biological systems, for classifying cell states in disease and for many other purposes.  Recent studies indicate that common assumptions currently embedded in experimental and analytical practices can lead to misinterpretation of global gene expression data.  We discuss these assumptions and describe solutions that should minimize erroneous interpretation of gene expression data from multiple analysis platforms.

(Submitter supplied) Linker histones are essential components of chromatin but the distributions and functions of many during cellular differentiation is not well understood. Here, we show that H1.5 binds to genic and intergenic regions, forming blocks of enrichment, in differentiated human cells from all three embryonic germ layers but not in embryonic stem cells. In differentiated cells, H1.5, but not H1.3, binds preferentially to genes that encode membrane and membrane-related proteins. more...

(Submitter supplied) The transcriptomic profiling of psoriasis has led to an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis. Although microarray technologies have been instrumental in this regard, it is clear that these tools detect an incomplete set of DEGs. RNA-seq can be used to supplement these prior technologies. Here, the use of RNAseq methods substantially increased the number of psoriasis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs that were uniquely identified by RNA-seq, but not in other published microarray studies, further supported the role of IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor-a synergy in psoriasis. more...

Little is known about its transcriptome-wide targets. We used high-throughput sequencing after crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) in human cells to identify the binding sites of the DEAD-box helicase eIF4AIII, an EJC core component. CLIP reads form peaks mainly located in spliced mRNAs. more...

(Submitter supplied) To uncover exon junction complex (EJC) deposition sites on cellular mRNAs, RNA footprints of EJC immuo-purified from HEK293 cells were deep sequenced. The analysis of these data revealed that major “canonical” EJC occupancy site in vivo lies 24 nucleotides upstream of exon junctions (-24 position) and that the majority of exon junctions carry an EJC. Unexpectedly, we find that many sites further upstream of -24 position are also enriched in these EJC footprints. more...

(Submitter supplied) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus linked to a number of B cell cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders. During latent infection, EBV expresses 25 viral pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and induces the expression of specific host miRNAs, such as miR-155 and miR-21, which potentially play a role in viral oncogenesis. To date, a limited number of EBV miRNA targets have been identified; thus, the role of EBV miRNAs in viral pathogenesis is not well defined. more...

Here we show that a 3.7kb lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high mRNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. more...

FUS/TLS is shown to bind RNAs from >5,500 genes in mouse and human brain, primarily through a GUGGU binding motif. A characteristic sawtooth-like binding pattern is identified, supporting co-transcriptional deposition of FUS/TLS. Depletion of FUS/TLS from the adult nervous system is shown to alter levels or splicing of >970 mRNAs, most of which are distinct from the RNAs whose maturation is dependent on TDP-43. more...

4344. RNA-Seq Analysis Reveals Different Dynamics of Differentiation of Human Dermis- and Adipose-derived Stromal Stem Cells
(Submitter supplied) Background: Tissue regeneration and recovery in the adult body depends on self-renewal and differentiation   of stem and progenitor cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have the ability to   differentiate into various cell types, have been isolated from the stromal fraction of virtually all   tissues. However, little is known about the true identity of MSCs. MSC populations exhibit great   tissue-, location- and patient-specific variation in gene expression and are heterogeneous in cell   composition. more...

(Submitter supplied) The TCF7L2 transcription factor is linked to a variety of human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding  to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in 6 human cell lines. We identified 116,000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites, with only 1,864  sites common to the 6 cell lines. more...

(Submitter supplied) Here, we use a novel technique for locating regions of N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) throughout the transcriptome and present a profile of m6A sites in the mouse brain. Our use of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with RNA-seq (MeRIP-Seq) identifies thousands of RNAs which contain m6A sites. In addition, we find that regions of m6A formation are particularly enriched near stop codons, which might provide clues into the potential funciton of this highly prevalent RNA modificaiton.

(Submitter supplied) RNA synthesis and decay rates determine the steady-state levels of cellular RNAs. Metabolic tagging of newly transcribed RNA by 4-thiouridine (4sU) can reveal the relative contributions of RNA synthesis and decay rates. The kinetics of RNA processing, however, so far remained unresolved. Here, we show that ultra-short 4sU-tagging not only provides snap-shot pictures of eukaryotic gene expression but, when combined with progressive 4sU-tagging and RNA-seq, reveals global RNA processing kinetics at nucleotide resolution. more...

4375. RNA-sequencing analysis of NB4 cells overexpressing miR-125b
(Submitter supplied) To better understand the mechanisms of blockage of myeloid differentiation and apoptosis and induction of proliferation by miR-125b, we proceeded to identify miR-125b target genes involved in these pathways. We analyzed the total cellular gene expression pattern by RNA-sequencing of the parental NB4 myeloid cell line and that transiently transfected with miR-125b. We generated four cDNA libraries corresponding to duplicates of miR-125b and control cells.

4376. Reorganization of the host epigenome by a viral oncogene
(Submitter supplied) Adenovirus small e1a causes ~70% reduction in cellular levels of histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18ac). It is unclear, however, where this dramatic reduction occurs genome-wide. ChIP-seq revealed that e1a erases 95% of H3K18ac peaks in normal fibroblasts and replaces them with one-third as many at new genomic locations. H3K18ac at promoters and intergenic regions of genes with fibroblast-related functions are relocalized after infection to promoters of highly-induced genes that regulate cell cycling and to new putative enhancers. more...

(Submitter supplied) Routine methods for assaying steady-state mRNA levels such as RNA-seq and micro-arrays are commonly used as readouts to study the role of transcription factors (TFs) in gene expression regulation. However, cellular RNA levels do not solely depend on activity of TFs and subsequent transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but are also affected by RNA turnover rate. Here, we demonstrate that integrated analysis of genome-wide TF occupancy, Pol II binding and steady-state RNA levels provide important insights in gene regulatory mechanisms. more...

However, the functional importance of NAGNAG alternative splicing is highly controversial. Using very deep RNA-Seq data from sixteen human and eight mouse tissues, we found that approximately half of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation and that regulated events have been selectively retained: alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was ten times as likely to be conserved between species as for non-tissue-specific events. more...

4409. "Calling Cards" for DNA-binding proteins in mammalian cells
(Submitter supplied) The ability to chronicle transcription factor binding events throughout the development of an organism would facilitate mapping of transcriptional networks that control cell fate decisions. We describe a method for permanently recording protein-DNA interactions in mammalian cells.  We endow transcription factors with the ability to deposit a transposon into the genome near to where they bind. The transposon becomes a “Calling Card” the transcription factor leaves behind to record its visit to the genome. more...

4412. Ribosome footprinting in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum
(Submitter supplied) In eukaryotic cells, the spatial regulation of protein expression is frequently conferred through the coupling of mRNA localization and the local control of translation. mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a prominent example of such regulation and serves a ubiquitous role in segregating the synthesis of secretory and integral membrane proteins to the ER. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have now expanded this view to suggest a role for the ER in global protein synthesis. more...

4420. Interferon-alpha mediates the development of autoimmunity by direct tissue toxicity and through immune-cell recruitment mechanisms
(Submitter supplied) Interferon-alpha is a major therapeutic agent for many diverse diseases.  However, the interferon-alpha mechanism of therapeutic action and associated side effects are not well understood. In particular, thyroiditis is a common unexplained complication.  We hypothesized that direct thyroid-toxic actions coupled with immune mechanisms play a major role in the thyroiditis etiology. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the actions of interferon-alpha on cultured thyrocytes in vitro, and in vivo by creating transgenic mice overexpressing interferon-alpha tissue specifically in thyrocytes. more...

4422. Genome-wide consequences of compromised NMD and their relavence for variable clinical phenotype of patients with UPF3B mutations [RNA-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) surveillance pathways are best known to be involved in the degradation of mRNA with premature termination codons (PTCs). More recent studies demonstrate that the role of NMD pathways goes well beyond the degradation of PTC containing mRNA, into the regulation of cell function and thus normal development. We have taken advantage of the availability of naturally occurring loss of function mutations in the UPF3B gene, a major component of the exon junction complex (EJC), to inquire about genome-wide consequences of compromised NMD. more...

4425. Identification of stromally expressed molecules in the prostate by Tag profiling of cancer-associated fibroblasts, normal fibroblasts and fetal prostate
(Submitter supplied) The stromal microenvironment plays key roles in prostate development and cancer. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and other stromal cells stimulate tumourigenesis via several mechanisms including the expression of pro-tumourigenic factors. Mesenchyme (embryonic stroma) controls prostate organogenesis, and in some circumstances can re-differentiate prostate tumours. Epithelia are regulated by powerful paracrine signalling from the stroma in both development and disease, and identification of these stromal signals is important. more...

Dramatic changes in the expression of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), pseudogenes, and splice isoforms were seen during the transition from pluripotent stem cells to early differentiating neurons. A number of genes that undergo radical changes in expression during this transition include candidates for schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that function as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, such as POU3F2 and ZNF804A, and genes coding for cell adhesion proteins implicated in these conditions including NRXN1 and NLGN1. more...

4436. An Alternative Splicing Switch Regulates Embryonic Stem Cell Pluripotency and Reprogramming [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Alternative splicing (AS) is a key process underlying the expansion of proteomic diversity and the regulation of gene expression. However, the contribution of AS to the control of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency is not well understood. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved ESC-specific AS event that changes the DNA binding preference of the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1. We show that the ESC-specific isoform of FOXP1 stimulates the expression of transcription factor genes required for pluripotency including OCT4, NANOG, NR5A2 and GDF3, while concomitantly repressing genes required for ESC differentiation. Remarkably, this isoform also promotes the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and the efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. These results thus reveal that an AS switch plays a pivotal role in the regulation of pluripotency and functions by controlling critical ESC-specific transcriptional programs.

4466. Digital gene expression and global mapping of polyadenylation sites with PolyA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) We describe PolyA-Seq, a strand-specific method for high-throughput sequencing of the 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts. PolyA-Seq is as accurate for digital gene expression as existing RNA sequencing approaches, and superior to microarrays. We used the approach to map polyadenylation (polyA) sites in 24 samples from normal tissues in human, rhesus, dog, mouse, and rat.

(Submitter supplied) The transmission of information from DNA to RNA is a critical process.  It is assumed that DNA is faithfully copied into RNA.  However, when we compared RNA sequences from human B cells of 27 individuals to the corresponding DNA sequences from the same individuals, we uncovered more than 20,000 sites where the RNA sequences do not match that of the DNA.  Validations using RNA sequences from another laboratory and re-sequencing of the DNA and RNA samples confirmed these findings. more...

4475. Reprogramming Transcriptional Responses through Functionally-Distinct Classes of Enhancers in Prostate Cancer Cells [ChIP-Seq, Gro-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Mammalian genomes are populated with thousands of transcriptional enhancers that orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression programs; however, the potential that there are pre-established enhancers in different functional classes that permit alternative signal-dependent transcriptional responses has remained unexplored. Here we present evidence that cell lineage-specific factors, such as FoxA1, can simultaneously facilitate and restrict key regulated transcription factors, exemplified by the androgen receptor (AR), acting at structurally- and functionally-distinct classes of pre-established enhancers, thus licensing specific signal-activated responses while restricting others. more...

4486. The C-Terminal Domain of RNA Polymerase II is Modified by Site-Specific Methylation
(Submitter supplied) The Carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in mammals undergoes extensive post-translational modification, which is essential for transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here, we show that the CTD of RNAPII is methylated at a single arginine (R1810) by the transcriptional co-activator CARM1. Although methylation at R1810 is present on the hyper-phosphorylated form of RNAPII in vivo, Ser-2 or Ser-5 phosphorylation inhibit CARM1 activity towards this site in vitro, suggesting that methylation occurs before transcription initiation. more...

However, the role of the basal splicing machinery in regulating AS remains poorly understood. Here we show that the core snRNP protein SmB/B’ self-regulates its expression by promoting the inclusion of a highly-conserved alternative exon in its own pre-mRNA that targets the spliced transcript for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). more...

4501. A unique chromatin signature uncovers early developmental enhancers in humans
(Submitter supplied) Cell fate transitions involve integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment. However, identification of the genomic sequences that control the earliest steps of human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, and monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1). more...

(Submitter supplied) Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that may have distinct or even antagonistic functions. To infer isoform regulation based on data from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-Seq), we have developed MISO, a computational model that estimates the expression level of alternatively spliced exons and mRNA isoforms and provides intuitive measures of conﬁdence in these estimates. more...

4510. Elucidating the stromal expression pattern in response to tumor-derived Shh
(Submitter supplied) Most tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract are known to depend on an excessive expression of Shh. It was recently discovered that this Shh does not signal on the tumor cells, but rather the stromal cells that in turn produce an unknown set of reciprocal signals that act as growth- or survival cues for the tumor cells. This sequencing effort aims to identify the reciprocal signals.

4519. Diverse endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the mammalian transcriptome depend upon microRNAs, Drosha, and additional nucleases
(Submitter supplied) Messenger RNAs are regulated by a variety of degradation mechanisms in mammalian cells.  In the canonical animal microRNA pathway, microRNAs in complex with Argonaute proteins bind to many mRNA targets with imperfect complementarity, leading to degradation of the mRNA through the regular decay machinery.  The ancestral “slicer” endonuclease activity of Argonaute2 itself, which requires more extensive complementarity with the target RNA, is not used in this pathway, and has only been observed in two microRNA-guided cases. more...

(Submitter supplied) Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the growth and development of the normal prostate and its malignant transformation.  More recently, a majority of prostate cancers have been shown to harbor recurrent gene fusions of the androgen-regulated gene, TMPRSS2, to the oncogenic ETS transcription factor ERG.  Here we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to explore the genome-wide localization of these transcription factors in human prostate cancer cell lines as well as tissues. more...

4537. PTB CLIP-seq
(Submitter supplied) Recent transcriptome analysis indicates that >90% of human genes undergoes alternative splicing, underscoring the contribution of differential RNA processing to diverse proteomes in higher eukaryotic cells. The polypyrimidine tract binding protein PTB is a well-characterized splicing repressor, but PTB knockdown causes both exon inclusion and skipping. Genome-wide mapping of PTB-RNA interactions and construction of a functional RNA map now revealed that dominant PTB binding near a competing constitutive splice site generally induces exon inclusion whereas prevalent binding close to an alternative site often causes exon skipping. more...

4538. Sex-specific and lineage-specific alternative splicing in primates
(Submitter supplied) Comparative studies of gene regulation suggest an important role for natural selection in shaping gene expression patterns within and between species. Most of these studies, however, estimated gene expression levels using microarray probes designed to hybridize to only a small proportion of each gene. Here we used recently-developed RNA sequencing protocols, which side-step this limitation, to assess intra- and inter-species variation in gene regulatory processes in considerably more detail than was previously possible. more...

4539. Effect of read-mapping biases on detecting allele-specific expression from RNA-sequencing data.
(Submitter supplied) Next-generation sequencing has become an important tool for genome-wide quantification of DNA and RNA.  However, a major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome.  Here we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE).We generated sixteen million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals. more...

4540. Illumina mRNA-Seq of control and hnRNP H knockdown in 293T cells
(Submitter supplied) Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated through combinatorial activity of RNA motifs including splice sites and splicing regulatory elements (SREs).  Here, we show that the activity of a major class of mammalian SREs is highly sensitive to the strength of the adjacent 5' splice site (5'ss) sequence, and that this has important functional and evolutionary implications.  Activity of G-run SREs was higher for intermediate strength 5'ss by ~4-fold relative to weak 5'ss, and by ~1.3-fold relative to strong 5'ss. more...

4541. UCSD Human Reference Epigenome Mapping Project
(Submitter supplied) The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. more...

4543. Detection of single nucleotide variations in expressed exons of the human genome using RNA-Seq
(Submitter supplied) Whole genome re-sequencing is still a costly method to detect genetic mutations that lead to altered forms of proteins and may be associated with disease development. Since the majority of disease-related single nucleotide variations (SNVs) are found in protein-coding regions, we propose to identify SNVs in expressed exons of the human genome using the recently developed RNA-Seq technique. We identify 12,176 and 10,621 SNVs, respectively, in Jurkat T cells and CD4+ T cells from a healthy donor. more...

(Submitter supplied) We carried out the first analysis of alternative splicing complexity in human tissues using mRNA-Seq data. New splice junctions were detected in 20% of multiexon genes, many of which are tissue specific. By combining mRNA-Seq and EST-cDNA sequence data, we estimate that transcripts from 95% of multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing and that there are 100,000 intermediate- to high-abundance alternative splicing events in major human tissues. more...

4546. Alternative Isoform Regulation in Human Tissue Transcriptomes
(Submitter supplied) Through alternative processing of pre-mRNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes based on deep sequencing of cDNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analysis of mappings of sequence reads to exon-exon junctions indicated that ~94% of human genes undergo alternative splicing (AS), ~86% with a minor isoform frequency of 15% or more. more...

4548. A Global View of Gene Activity and Alternative Splicing by Deep Sequencing of the Human Transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptome of HEK and B cells were analyzed by microarray and RNA-Seq parallely. Both platforms were then compared in terms of sensitivity. To assess whether values were a reliable indicator of gene activity, we correlated these values with hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II (PolIIa) occupancy, used as a landmark of transcription initiation. For HEK, we identified PolIIa islands by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq).
